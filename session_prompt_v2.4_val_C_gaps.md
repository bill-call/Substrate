# SESSION PROMPT: v2.4 Validation — Part C: Gap Analysis

## Instructions

Follow CLAUDE.md session protocol. Load spine (`substrate_spine.md`) first. Load other documents ONLY for specific gap checks.

READ-ONLY. For each gap, assess: DOCUMENTED / PARTIAL / MISSING. If partial, note what exists and what's missing. Under 2000 words total.

## Gaps to Probe

### 1. Gas Intake Scaling
How does atmospheric SiH₄ intake scale with organism size? Diffusion-limited for small organisms, convective for large. Where is the crossover? Check spine §AMORPH BIOLOGY (metabolic rate scaling ~M^0.85) and bible §8. Is there a consistent intake model?

### 2. Merge Data Transfer
What happens to the molecular library during amorph merge? Both libraries combine? Conflict resolution? Check spine §AMORPH BIOLOGY and §MOLECULAR LIBRARY, bible §8 (merge section). Is the mechanism documented beyond "combined meme pool"?

### 3. Energy Budget Self-Consistency
Spine says: 300W rest, 750W active, 5000W peak for 100 kg amorph. Atmospheric SiH₄ at 0.3% (2400 Pa partial pressure). Can atmospheric SiH₄ metabolism sustain 300W baseline? Check: SiH₄ diffusion flux to organism surface, enthalpy of SiH₄ processing. Is there a documented calculation or just an assertion?

### 4. Social Prerequisites
What social structures exist before awakening? Consensus-by-merge governance, farmer caste, battery organisms, shell economy. Check spine §CIVILIZATION and bible §11-12. Are the prerequisites for organized civilization documented, or does civilization appear without foundation?

### 5. Warfare Supply Chain
Check spine §CIVILIZATION (iodine laser, biological railgun, fluorine weapons). For each weapon system:
- Is the full supply chain documented (raw materials → manufacturing → deployment)?
- Are logistics gaps identified?
- Is the iodine laser meme-compartmentalization model internally consistent?

### 6. Shore Ecology
Spine says shore/intertidal is "richest marine zone" and "primary nutrient delivery system." Check bible §9 marine sections. Is there supporting ecological detail beyond the nutrient delivery claim? Species, food web structure, energy flows?

### 7. Thorn-Flora Energy
Spine describes dual-source energy: geothermal (thermoelectric roots) + solar (heliostat + PV organ). Check: are the thermoelectric and heliostat mechanisms physically described, or just named? Is there an energy budget?

### 8. Skywhale Metabolism
Three-phase cycle: charge, atmospheric feed, sea-dip. Check spine skywhale entry. Is the energy budget closed? Can peristaltic tentacle feeding supply enough catalytic metals? What's the metabolic cost of the sea-dip descent/ascent in 1.82g?

### 9. Middle Kingdom Taxonomy
Beyond Healers/Miners/Guards, what tower-coupled organisms exist? Railgun projectiles, Voronoi armor are mentioned in spine. Check bible §7 and fauna hub. Are these developed beyond single-line mentions?

### 10. Working Memory Ceiling
Federation bypasses single-network collapse. Check spine §MONKS and bible §8 (working memory). Is the collapse mechanism physically described? What exactly fails when a single semiconductor network gets too large?
