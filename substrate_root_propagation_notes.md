## 1. FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

### 1a. The lattice is never alive

The lattice is inert N:SiC mineral — the product of catalytic reactions on active growing surfaces. It does not grow, metabolize, or respond. The mineral is permanent, conductive, and chemically inert regardless of whether catalytic chemistry is active on its surfaces.

### 1b. The deep-rock biosphere is NOT an organism

**Critical framing.** The deep-rock "biosphere" is a chemically active face — a reaction front of metallosilazane catalytic chemistry — with a trail of dead (inert) lattice behind it, leading back to the vent-crack point of origin. No bounded body. No reproduction in the conventional sense. The front self-perpetuates as long as feedstock (SiH₄) and energy (geothermal) are available.

Implications:
1. **No reproduction problem.** A reaction front advances, not reproduces. New catalytic material is synthesized at the face from precursors in the fracture gas.
2. **No boundary problem.** A single vent may feed dozens of active faces in branching fractures. Independent fronts sharing a supply chain. Analogous to a chemical wave, not an organism.
3. **Continuous with pool genesis.** Pool genesis chemistry (coacervation, amphiphile assembly) is also phase-separated catalytic chemistry, not an organism. The deep-rock active face is the same CLASS of thing. Pool genesis → organisms happens later, at the lineage fork. The deep-rock biosphere never makes that transition.
4. **The trail IS the tower.** Everything behind the active face is dead mineral. The tower above is its waste product — like a coral reef to its polyp layer, except the polyp layer is molecular-scale and the reef is kilometers tall.
5. **Open question: what carries the catalytic chemistry?** The metallosilazane enzymes must be embedded in something at the active face. Options: (a) thin silazane polymer film advancing on the fresh lattice surface, (b) free catalytic complexes in fracture gas/condensate, (c) solid self-regenerating catalytic coating. Key question for root chemistry specialist session.

### 1c. Spine terminology update needed

Spine uses "deep-rock colony" in 4 locations (lines 77, 129, 159, 329). "Colony" imports organism assumptions. Needs revision to "deep-rock system," "deep-rock front," or "deep-rock catalytic network." Consistent pass needed across spine, bible, and all hubs.

---

## 2. DEEP-ROCK FRACTURE CHEMISTRY

### 2a. The reaction front

- **Agent:** Chemically active face — metallosilazane catalytic chemistry. NOT an organism.
- **Energy:** Geothermal (>500°C available at 15–25 km depth)
- **Feedstock:** Geothermal SiH₄ percolating through fractures
- **Chemistry:** Metallosilazane enzymes catalyze SiH₄ + CH₄ + NH₃ → polycarbosilane intermediates (PCS). Geothermal heat ceramifies PCS → N:SiC. Enzymes embedded in/on the advancing face; lattice behind them is dead mineral.
- **Control:** Autonomous. Follows SiH₄ gradient. No network control (predates network).
- **Environment:** Fracture networks in bedrock. Reducing buffer (metallic Si consumes H₂O → near-zero H₂O). Gas-phase or mixed.

### 2b. The fracture as exothermic chimney

The carbosilane reaction is **exothermic** (−33 kJ/mol). Fracture walls lined with active catalytic surfaces are heating elements. Gas rising through the fracture picks up heat from both:
- Geothermal gradient (temperature increases with depth)
- Exothermic wall reactions (distributed along the entire active surface)

The fracture is a chimney: hot gas rises, ammonia infall from the surface vaporizes on contact with hot walls, the upward gas stream accelerates. What exits at the surface is a **superheated jet** of SiH₄ + vaporized NH₃ + H₂ + CH₄.

### 2c. ~~Continuous vs. front-only active surfaces~~ RESOLVED: Front-only

**⚠ CORRECTED (Feb 2026, follow-up session).** The "continuous active wake" model is wrong. Behind the advancing front, pore throats narrow below SiH₄ molecular diameter (~4.1 Å) but above H₂ (~2.9 Å). This creates a **molecular sieve**: H₂ permeates (entire fill is H₂-venting), SiH₄ cannot reach interior surfaces. Isolated pores (no connected porosity to the gas supply) are functionally solid. **No active tail. All catalytic activity confined to the advancing face.**

**Three rate regimes for front advance:**
1. Gas-transport colonization of new fractures: ~mm/s, geologically instantaneous
2. Channel-fed active deposition: ~μm/s, declining as pores narrow
3. Matrix-diffusion stasis: ~5 nm/yr when all connected fractures filled

**Exothermic thermal self-fracturing:** ΔH = −33 kJ/mol. Filling a 1mm fracture heats adjacent ~1cm rock shell by ~20K — at silicate thermal cracking threshold. The reaction cracks its own host rock at depth, creating new fractures. Self-propagating mechanically, not just chemically.

**Chimney self-selection:** Surface-connected fractures maintain open gas channels (chimney draft = short residence time; shallow zone too cold for PCS deposition). Dead-end fractures fill solid (no draft → seal). Network self-prunes: surface-connected paths survive as permanent chimneys, dead ends fill and die.

<details><summary>Original §2c (invalidated)</summary>

Inside the fracture, the advancing front colonizes virgin wall surface. But behind the front, the wall surfaces still have: exposed catalytic surface (not buried), SiH₄ feedstock (still percolating through), and geothermal heat (ambient at depth). The walls remain active after the front passes.

The reaction is exothermic and thermodynamically downhill — every surface with catalyst and SiH₄ **wants** to react. No energy barrier prevents continuous activity on all colonized surfaces. The fracture fills from all walls inward simultaneously. The front is the colonization event; the wake is continuous production.

Pores narrow as PCS deposits on all internal surfaces. Eventually the fracture fills, gas flow chokes, reaction starves. Dead lattice. But for active fractures with ongoing SiH₄ supply, the walls produce indefinitely.

</details>

## 3. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE SURFACE: PROTO-TOWER AND POOL

### 3a. The monadnock

The deep-rock reaction front reaches the surface through fractures. Its surface expression is a **monadnock** — an SiC outcrop (Mohs 9.5) surviving differential erosion against silicate bedrock (Mohs 6–7). Erosion ratio ~100,000:1. Pre-biotic silicate terrain erodes at ~600 mm/Myr; monadnock erosion ~0.006 mm/Myr.

The monadnock is the tallest, most conductive object in the local landscape. In the terminator's continuous thunderstorm, it is the preferred lightning target.

### 3b. Pool colonization geometry — ~~ice-on-a-lake model~~ SUPERSEDED BY GEYSER-CONE MODEL

**⚠ INVALIDATED (Feb 2026, follow-up session).** The lily-pad/sponge model fails because pore isolation physics applies to the sponge: pore throats narrow below SiH₄ molecular diameter (~4.1 Å), isolating interior pores. Isolated pores = functionally solid. The sponge is NOT a porous reactor — it's an effectively solid mass. Same physics that kills the "active tail" in deep fractures (§2c correction below) kills the sponge-as-reactor.

**REPLACED BY: Geyser-cone mechanism.** When the reaction front reaches the pool floor, the throat zone (where gas meets liquid) deposits PCS rapidly. Throat narrows, seals with PCS membrane, back-pressure builds, membrane fractures — geyser burst ejects PCS debris into pool. Ejecta deposits in rings around vent (size-sorted by distance). Inner ring cements → cone grows upward through pool. Vent channel stays clear (scoured by each burst). Cone breaches surface → lightning rod → ceramifies → proto-tower. See Pool Genesis Hub §2.6 for full mechanism.

**Genesis occurs in the Goldilocks ring** (intermediate distance from vent): catalytically active PCS fragments in liquid ammonia, slow cementing, periodically agitated by geyser bursts. Fragment surfaces provide catalytic sites; dissolved metals and building materials delivered radially from vent. Dynamic stratigraphy (cemented bed → loose surface → turbid suspension).

~~When the catalytic front reaches a pool from the fracture below, it colonizes the **air-ammonia interface first** (lily-pad geometry).~~ [Original text preserved below for reference]

<details><summary>Original §3b (invalidated)</summary>

When the catalytic front reaches a pool from the fracture below, it colonizes the **air-ammonia interface first** (lily-pad geometry). The interface is where atmospheric SiH₄ from above and dissolved catalysts from below overlap. Growth is fastest laterally at the interface, slower into the volume below.

The lily pad is **transient** — same physics as ice forming on a lake surface. The interior fills in behind: all pore walls are catalytically active, dissolved SiH₄ is replenished through the porous mat from the atmosphere, H₂ waste convection stirs the pool. Volume-fill timescale for a small genesis pool (~1 m deep): days to weeks. Geologically instantaneous.

**Every fracture-connected pool fills with porous PCS sponge.**

The sponge is self-limiting: pores narrow until they're too small for large catalyst molecules to infiltrate. SiH₄ and H₂ (small molecules) still permeate. The sponge becomes a **molecular sieve** — large complex molecules are trapped in pore spaces, feedstock gases flow freely. This is an emergent concentration apparatus, not a designed membrane.

</details>

### 3c. Vent thermal regime

NH₃ boiling point at 8 bar ≈ 291K. Pool sits at 240K — only 51K subcooling. The superheated gas jet from the fracture chimney (§2b) hits the pool:

- **Small pool + vigorous deep vent:** flash-vaporization. Not a pool — a fumarole. Liquid can't persist.
- **Large pool + moderate vent:** vent is local. Pool persists but is heated (accelerated kinetics, faster pore-filling).
- **Nonlinear threshold** between pool and fumarole, set by heat flux vs. pool volume vs. rain replenishment.

Genesis requires the **sweet spot:** large pool, moderate vent, monadnock shelter.

### 3d. Two pool types (narrative knob)

- **Fracture-connected pools:** filled with sponge by the catalytic front. Genesis occurs in lattice context. These produce towers.
- **Non-connected pools:** rain-fed, on unfractured bedrock, in lee of towers. Remain open water. Can host open-water ecology.

The ratio is a **narrative parameter** — constrained by geology we haven't specified and don't need to. Both types exist at the terminator.

---

## 4. CERAMIFICATION AND THE THREE-ZONE MODEL

### 4a. Ceramification chemistry (verified)

**Catalyzed temperature:** Uncatalyzed PCS → SiC requires >800°C (Yajima process). Fe/Ni nanoparticle-catalyzed: onset ~600°C, significant at 700°C (dissolution-precipitation mechanism). Biological metallosilazane catalysts: estimated 400–600°C for partial ceramification above conductivity percolation threshold (~15–30% volume fraction SiC). **Verdict: SOUND.**

**I²R pulsed heating:** SiC thermal conductivity (~120 W/m·K) prevents sustained heating. Pulsed model: ~1 ms bursts, ~0.15 J/pulse, ~12 A peak. ~17 pulses to percolation threshold. Average power ~2.5 mW. Trivial vs. lightning budget. **Verdict: SOUND.**

**Lightning as PECVD reactor:** Lightning in SiH₄/CH₄/NH₃/H₂ atmosphere deposits SiC/SiCN films on strike surfaces. Established industrial chemistry (Chemistry Hub §9). Energy per strike at contact: ~10–100 kJ. Conductive deposit attracts subsequent strikes (positive feedback). **Verdict: NEAR-INEVITABLE.** Strongest claim in the worldbuilding.

**Enzyme function in liquid ammonia:** Metallosilazane scaffold stable in liquid NH₃ (native solvent). H₂O attacks the scaffold (K ≈ 10⁵); NH₃ does not. Active-site selectivity achievable via binding-pocket geometry. Polysilazane scaffold more robust than protein: Si-N bonds ~440 kJ/mol vs. peptide ~340. **Verdict: SOUND** at <6 ppm H₂O. Rapid destruction at 50 ppm.

### 4b. Three-zone vertical model

| Zone | Depth | Heat source | Material | Conductivity | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Surface (sponge + tower) | 0 to ~tens of m | Lightning (top-down, via H₂ plume) | SiC | Conductive | Signal processing, lightning capture, habitat |
| Shallow fracture | ~tens to ~hundreds of m | Neither | PCS | **Insulating** | **Grounding bottleneck** |
| Deep fracture | ~hundreds of m to km+ | Geothermal + exothermic | SiC | Conductive | Catalytic front, deep-rock connection |

Exact depth boundaries are site-dependent. The existence of three zones follows from physics; exact boundaries don't matter.

### 4c. Surface ceramification: top-down, distributed, progressive

Lightning strikes the pool sponge guided by the H₂ plume (§5a). The surface layer ceramifies (PCS → SiC). Once conductive, it acts as an electrode: the next strike's current flows through the ceramified layer, hits the PCS beneath, I²R heating at the resistance mismatch ceramifies the next layer down.

**Ceramification back-propagates downward through the sponge.** Each cycle extends the conductive zone deeper. Strikes are distributed across the surface (H₂ vents from entire sponge, not one point), so ceramification is spatially uniform. The sponge hardens in place.

The front also propagates some distance down the fracture, but SiC is a semiconductor, not a superconductor. Resistance accumulates with path length. At some depth, current at the front can't deliver enough I²R heating. The front stalls. → PCS gap persists (§4d).

### 4d. The PCS gap — narrative-critical constraint

The PCS insulating zone in the shallow fracture is a **grounding bottleneck**. The tower captures continuous lightning but can't dump the full charge through the high-resistance crack.

**The PCS gap forces the tower to develop lateral surface roots for grounding.** Fracture can't absorb the load → tower must dump excess charge laterally → surface roots spread to increase ground contact area.

Without the PCS gap: adequate crack grounding → no lateral roots → no network → no wars → no intelligence.

**Growth feedback:** bigger tower → more lightning capture → more excess charge → more root expansion → more surface area → tower grows taller → captures more lightning. Horizontal expansion scales with vertical growth.

Three arguments for gap persistence: (1) lightning current can't penetrate through accumulated resistance, (2) geothermal gradient doesn't reach high enough, (3) exothermic self-heating too slow on relevant timescales.

---

## 5. H₂ PLUME AND SPONGE-REACTOR GENESIS — KEY FINDINGS

### 5a. H₂ plume as self-targeting lightning guide

The catalytic reaction in sponge pores produces H₂ as gaseous waste. H₂ vents upward through the pores, forming a plume above the pool surface. H₂ dielectric breakdown voltage ≈ **half** that of N₂ (at 8 bar: ~14 kV/mm vs. ~28 kV/mm). In the intense electric field near the continuously-struck monadnock, the H₂ plume ionizes first — corona discharge at field strengths that leave bulk atmosphere intact. The partially ionized column is a conductive streamer precursor.

**The pool's own waste product draws lightning into it.**

The plume is distributed across the entire exposed sponge surface:
- Lightning does not repeatedly strike the same location (distributed streamers)
- Craters are shallow, at or below pool surface level — easily recolonized by active sponge interior
- Ceramification is spatially uniform across the sponge (distributed strikes)

### 5b. Positive feedback: the sponge-reactor cycle

1. Catalytic reaction in sponge pores → H₂ waste
2. H₂ plume → low-breakdown column above pool
3. Lightning follows plume into sponge
4. Lightning ceramifies PCS → SiC (conductive patches) **AND** does PECVD in pore atmosphere (SiH₄/NH₃/CH₄/H₂ plasma in confined pore spaces with catalytic walls and liquid ammonia solvent)
5. More SiC → better current paths → more reaction → more H₂ → more lightning capture

### 5c. ~~Genesis environment: the sponge IS the reactor~~ INVALIDATED

**⚠ INVALIDATED (Feb 2026, follow-up session).** Same pore-isolation physics that kills the active tail (§2c) kills the sponge-as-reactor. Pore throats narrow and isolate; SiH₄ can't reach interior surfaces; the sponge is functionally solid, not a porous reactor. **Genesis does NOT occur inside the sponge.**

**REPLACED BY: Geyser-cone + Goldilocks ring model (see §3b revision and Pool Genesis Hub §2.6).** Genesis occurs in the liquid ammonia phase on and between catalytically active PCS fragments ejected by the geyser mechanism — a fundamentally different transport regime (liquid-phase diffusion + convection in open void space, not gas diffusion through closed pores).

<details><summary>Original §5c (invalidated)</summary>

Lightning-driven PECVD inside confined pore spaces creates complex molecules (proto-enzymes, amphiphiles, coacervate precursors). The sponge provides:
- **Catalytic pore walls** — surface chemistry
- **Liquid ammonia solvent** — saturating the pore network
- **Molecular sieve geometry** — pores too small for large molecules to escape, permeable to feedstock gases (SiH₄, H₂). Emergent concentration apparatus.
- **Distributed lightning energy** — every strike seeds a column of pore spaces with PECVD products

This is not genesis in a calm pool. It is genesis inside a self-targeting lightning reactor built from the tower's own chemistry.

</details>

### 5d. Genesis timing window

The ceramification front migrates downward through the sponge (§4c). Behind the front: dead SiC ceramic. Ahead of the front: PCS with active chemistry, ammonia solvent, confined PECVD products. **Genesis occurs in the band of pore space ahead of the advancing ceramification front.**

The same lightning strikes that drive the front also seed the pore spaces ahead of it with complex molecules. The front creates the genesis chemistry AND destroys the genesis environment, in sequence, top to bottom. Pool depth sets the time window.

The spine metaphor holds literally: "Deep-rock is the TRUNK. Towers are branches. Amorphs are fruit." The fruit grows inside the branch.

---

## 6. SURFACE ROOT GROWTH (POST-NETWORK)

### 6a. Healer-built roots — working model

- **Agent:** Tower-coupled Healers (mm-scale, middle kingdom), supplied by Miners, quality-controlled by Guards
- **Energy:** Tower grid (lightning-harvested). Arc-CVD primary mechanism.
- **Feedstock:** Atmospheric SiH₄ (0.3%, 8 bar), flowing across construction surface
- **Control:** Network-mediated via energy-gradient tropism. Network modulates lattice voltage → Healers follow gradient → construction front advances where directed.
- **Primary driver:** Grounding need (§4d). Tower must expand ground contact area to handle growing lightning load.
- **Status:** Working model. Pending root chemistry specialist verification.

### 6b. Why roots don't enter pools/seas

Three independent barriers prevent Healer-built root colonization of open water:

**Biological:** Healers can't do arc-CVD submerged (arc requires gas gap, liquid quenches arc, no SiH₄ flow-through). CAN work in rain and shallow puddles (arc vaporizes mm-scale film). Threshold: ~few mm standing liquid. Roots meander around permanent water.

**Chemical:** Metallosilazane enzymes petrify at >6 ppm H₂O (K ≈ 10⁵). Mature seas at ~50 ppm: catalyst destroyed on contact. Belt-and-suspenders with biological barrier.

**Economic:** Submerged lattice captures no lightning. Poor ROI. Selected against over geological time.

| Environment | Healer | Petrification | ROI | Root grows? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dry surface | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Rain/wet surface | — | — | — | **Yes** |
| Shallow puddle (<few mm) | Marginal | — | — | **Yes, slowly** |
| Standing water (>1 cm) | **Blocked** | Depends | Weak | **No** |
| Fresh pool (<1 ppm H₂O) | **Blocked** | — | Moderate | **No** |
| Mature sea (~50 ppm H₂O) | **Blocked** | **Blocked** | **Blocked** | **No (triple)** |

Note: These barriers apply to **Healer-built surface roots only.** The deep-rock catalytic front fills fracture-connected pools regardless (§3b). The two mechanisms have different pool-invasion behavior.

---

## 7. ESTABLISHED LATTICE — IMMUNITY AND CONSEQUENCES

### 7a. SiC/SiCN is immune to petrification

Petrification attacks silAZANE bonds (Si-NH-Si → Si-O-Si). The lattice is silicon CARBIDE (Si-C) and silicon carbonitride (SiCN ceramic). Si-C bonds are not hydrolyzed by H₂O at 240K. SiCN ceramic Si-N bonds are kinetically inaccessible (locked in rigid matrix). Self-passivating glass rind at most.

Established lattice submerged in ammonia at any H₂O concentration: structurally sound, conductive, permanent.

### 7b. Submerged roots as marine habitat

A root built across dry terrain that later floods becomes free marine infrastructure:
- Physical reef framework (porous lattice)
- EM sanctuary (conductive lattice = Faraday cage; privacy in liquid ammonia otherwise impossible)
- Grid-connected (if still linked to living tower)
- Maintenance-free (inert mineral)
- Colonizable by marine organisms that independently evolve Schottky coupling to N:SiC

The marine ecosystem doesn't need the tower to grow into the sea. The sea comes to the lattice. Ghost roots (subsurface root network — NOT migration trails; towers are stationary) submerged by expanding seas = prime marine real estate.

---

## 8. ROOT SPANNING AND LANDSCAPE EROSION

### 8a. Root as capstone

Roots protect bedrock beneath them from wind erosion (SiC Mohs 9.5 capping silicate Mohs 6–7). Surrounding terrain erodes → roots become elevated causeways/mesas.

Peneplain forms regardless of towers (stagnant-lid wind erosion), but towers accelerate it by loading wind with SiC particulate (hardness differential → industrial grinding).

### 8b. Maximum unsupported span

Bio-deposited SiC/SiCN, ~50% porosity, 1.82g. Conservative fracture stress ~50 MPa (Griffith, K_IC ≈ 3 MPa√m).

| Root cross-section | Max static span | Practical (fatigue) |
|---|---|---|
| 10 cm × 5 cm | ~11 m | **~7 m** |
| 30 cm × 10 cm | ~16 m | **~10 m** |
| 50 cm × 20 cm | ~23 m | **~15 m** |

Wind load secondary (~6% of gravity). SiC is brittle — failure is sudden fracture, not gradual deformation.

### 8c. Landscape evolution

1. **Fresh (0–1 My):** Root flat on irregular terrain, follows contours.
2. **Causeways (1–100 My):** Terrain erodes around root. Raised ridges.
3. **Arches (100–500 My):** Pedestals narrow. Root bridges gaps <15 m.
4. **Collapse (500 My+):** Spans exceed critical length. Brittle fracture. SiC rubble fields.
5. **Remnants (peneplain):** SiC fragments in polished bedrock. Topographic ghost of ancient network.

### 8d. Network vulnerability

Root bridge collapse severs signal paths. Chronic infrastructure aging requiring continuous bypass construction. Not catastrophic (unlike dark-side plume breakthrough), but persistent network stress.

### 8e. Geological archaeology

Ghost root meanders record ancient terrain. Monks studying root plan-forms could reconstruct the planet's surface from My ago.

---

## 9. SHORE ECOLOGY — FRAMEWORK (SKETCHED, NOT FULLY BUILT)

### 9a. Zonation (wave-driven, no tides)

No moon. Dynamic water level from wind waves (~0.5–2 m amplitude, enclosed basins, 8-bar wind on 660 kg/m³ ammonia) and tower vortex shedding. Statistical exposure gradient ~1–3 m.

| Zone | H₂O stress | SiH₄ access | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spray zone | Very low | Atmospheric | Deposition landing zone. Biofilm. Safest marine-adjacent. |
| Swash zone | Moderate (intermittent) | Dual | Bilingual zone. Amphibious organisms. |
| Shallow subtidal | ~50 ppm (bulk) | Dissolved (surface-enriched) | Full marine, wave-mixed. |
| Tower-base reef | ~50 ppm | Dissolved + grid | EM-shielded. Feral lattice habitat. |
| Open water | ~50 ppm | Dissolved (declining) | Medusa-fish territory. |

### 9b. Shore as nutrient gateway

Atmospheric conveyor deposits material at shore (the ONE place on the dark side where material accumulates). Processing cascade: plume hawks (aerial, first access) → spray-zone biofilm → waterline filter-feeders → shore amorphs → wave resuspension → marine food web.

### 9c. Shore-specific organisms (sketched)

- **Glass barnacles:** Sessile waterline encrusters. SiO₂ shells via controlled petrification.
- **Waterline filter-feeders:** Dual-medium filtration. SiC framework, glass-armored water surfaces.
- **Wave-riders:** Swash-zone specialists exploiting alternating exposure for dual SiH₄ access.
- **Submerged-lattice colonists:** On inert tower/root lattice below waterline. EM-shielded, possibly grid-tapping.
- **Shore medusa-fish:** H₂O spray has longer range in air — can hit terrestrial organisms from water.
- **Bilingual shore amorphs:** Operate in both media. Information brokers, trade intermediaries, intelligence assets.

### 9d. Petrification gradient as evolutionary nursery

Shore provides graduated H₂O exposure: spray zone (<6 ppm) → swash (intermittent 50 ppm) → subtidal (continuous 50 ppm) → deep sea. Evolutionary ramp from pool genesis (<1 ppm) to full marine life. Nursery: juveniles develop in safe spray zone, shift deeper as defenses mature.

## 10. EVOLUTIONARY PATHWAYS FROM GENESIS

### 10a. ~~The lineage fork — sponge geometry as sorting mechanism~~ INVALIDATED / REPLACED

**⚠ INVALIDATED (Feb 2026, follow-up session).** Sponge pore-isolation physics (see §2c, §3b, §5c corrections) means pores are not navigable habitats. The sponge is functionally solid. No organisms live inside it. The geometric sorting mechanism doesn't operate.

**REPLACED BY: Cone-wall dimorphism (proposed).** The geyser-built volcanic cone creates two distinct niches:
- **Inside cone (sealed pool):** depleting SiH₄, rich in dissolved metals, liquid ammonia → favors coacervation → amorphs
- **Outside cone (atmospheric surface):** abundant SiH₄, solid surface, lightning → favors membrane organisms that survive rim crossing → sexuals → first tower symbiotes

The cone rim is a selective filter: membrane = survive transition; no membrane = trapped in pool. See Pool Genesis Hub §2.6. Status: proposed, complements the chemical fork (§4.3 in Pool Genesis Hub).

<details><summary>Original §10a (invalidated)</summary>

Both lineages (amorphs, sexuals) originate in sponge pore spaces via the same PECVD-driven chemistry. The chemical fork (coacervation → amorphs, amphiphile assembly → sexuals) is established in the pool genesis hub. The sponge provides an additional **geometric sorting mechanism:**

- **Amorphs** (no fixed body, reconfigurable): can squeeze through irregular, tortuous pore geometry. Thrive in complex 3D lattice. No pressure to leave. They stay.
- **Sexuals** (rigid body plan, fixed geometry): increasingly constrained as pores narrow. Under selection pressure to escape to open space. They preferentially migrate OUT through the pore network to sponge margins.

The sponge retains amorphs and exports sexuals. Not by design — by geometry.

</details>

### 10b. The evolutionary rate asymmetry

**Amorphs** have memes (catalytic patterns, transferable by transcription). Meme evolution is glacial — transcription errors only, no recombination, no sexual selection.

**Sexuals** have genomes. Recombination, mutation, selection, generational turnover. Orders of magnitude faster adaptation.

Sexuals exported to open water hit an adaptive radiation. New environments, new selection pressures, rapid genomic response. Every sexual niche in the world — marine, shore, aerial, lattice-symbiote — is a branch of this radiation. The tower's physical adaptation rate is paced by sexual evolution (established in skywhale hub: "Sexual organisms are structural pacemaker"). The amorphs are still running last epoch's memes.

### 10c. Path: sexuals → tower symbiotes

1. Genesis in sponge pores (both lineages)
2. Sexuals exported to open water via sponge margins
3. Adaptive radiation in marine/terrestrial environments
4. Some sexuals re-encounter lattice (submerged roots, tower bases)
5. Evolve Schottky coupling → grid power access → massive selective advantage
6. Specialize into guild niches (Healers, Miners, Guards) via rapid genomic evolution
7. Chelation badges, field-emitter arrays, metal transport morphology — all genomic innovations

Prodigal sons: sexuals that left the sponge, diversified outside, and returned as specialized mutualists bringing capabilities the amorphs can't produce.

### 10d. Path: sexuals → medusa-fish

1. Genesis in sponge pores
2. Sexuals exported to open water
3. Marine petrification pressure → biological distillation (genomic, fast)
4. Buoyancy problem → H₂ bladder (repurposed metabolic waste, genomic)
5. Predator-prey arms races → H₂O weapons, glass armor, Tesla valves
6. Shore petrification gradient (§9d) as evolutionary nursery/ramp
7. → medusa-fish: apex marine predator, mobile reef node

### 10e. PATH NOT ESTABLISHED: pore-dwelling amorphs → surface megafauna

**This is a major gap.** We have:
- Sponge pore amorphs: ≤100 μm, catalytic, no fixed body plan, living in lattice pore spaces
- Surface megafauna amorphs: macroscopic, mobile, intelligent, tool-using, interacting with towers from outside

The transition involves:
- Scale: ≤100 μm → macroscopic (orders of magnitude)
- Environment: confined lattice pores → open surface
- Lifestyle: sessile pore-dweller → mobile megafauna
- Cognition: minimal catalytic chemistry → working memory, meme architecture, federation

Possible mechanisms (NONE VERIFIED):
- Growth within increasingly large lattice channels (5 zones/strut, outer zones have larger flow spaces) → emergence at lattice surface → continued growth on tower exterior
- Budding/export events producing surface-dwelling offspring
- Metamorphic transition at some threshold size
- Lattice channels as size-selective habitat gradient (deeper = smaller pores, outer = larger = larger amorphs)

**This gap must be resolved before the evolutionary model is complete.** It is the amorph equivalent of the sexual sponge-export pathway, and it currently lacks a mechanism.

## 11. OPEN THREADS

### ~~Terminology (spine + bible)~~ DONE
- [x] ~~Replace "deep-rock colony" with "deep-rock system/front/catalytic network" across all documents.~~ Completed in terminology pass (Feb 2026).

### ~~Root chemistry~~ PARTIALLY RESOLVED (Feb 2026, pre-Healer root session)
- [ ] Physical substrate of metallosilazane enzymes at active face — what carries the catalytic chemistry? **Still open** (deep-rock specific; not needed for surface root resolution).
- [x] ~~Healer-built vs. electrochemical autonomous surface root model~~ **RESOLVED.** Pre-Healer roots are Phase 1 autocatalytic surface growth, not a separate mechanism. Same N:SiC surface catalysis that builds the tower, extending laterally along exposed fracture traces. Amplified by resistance crossover: as PCS gap downward ceramification stalls (power ∝ 1/R²_total), lightning current shifts to lateral paths (Kirchhoff). Pre-biotic proto-roots — dendritic, fracture-following, slow (mm/yr to cm/yr). Healers inherit and optimize with arc-CVD. See Tower Morphology Hub §2.2.
- [x] ~~Root substrate bonding — first Healer layer on bare bedrock~~ Subsumed: Healers deposit on pre-existing Phase 1 root lattice, not bare bedrock. Adhesion question dissolves.
- [x] ~~Root growth rate~~ Pre-Healer: geological (mm/yr to cm/yr, feedstock-limited by atmospheric PCS deposition). Healer-built: orders of magnitude faster (arc-CVD from raw atmospheric gas). "Generational" refers to Healer-era network expansion, not Phase 1 proto-roots.
- [x] **NEW RESOLVED — Catalytic surface dead in modern towers.** Healer SiCN lacks metallosilazane catalytic sites. Ship of Theseus replaced all original material. "Reaction front only" is Phase 1 early-life state, not degradation. Modern crisis: full reef → degraded → inert. Irreversible.

### ~~Sponge-reactor genesis~~ CLOSED — model invalidated
- [x] ~~Reconcile sponge-reactor model with existing pool genesis hub~~ Sponge model invalidated. Replaced by geyser-cone + Goldilocks ring (Pool Genesis Hub §2.6).
- [x] ~~Genesis timing window~~ No longer relevant — genesis occurs in liquid phase around fragments, not inside sponge ahead of ceramification front.
- [x] ~~PECVD product spectrum in confined pore spaces~~ No longer relevant — pores are isolated, not active reactor spaces.

### Amorph origin transition (HIGH PRIORITY — revised framing)
- [ ] Mechanism for coacervate → megafauna transition. Cone-wall model: amorphs originate as coacervates in sealed pool inside cone (Pool Genesis Hub §2.6). Depleting SiH₄ creates scarcity selection. Eventually escape pool (silazane oil coating for atmospheric survival). But: what drives scale increase from ≤100 μm to macroscopic?
- [ ] Pool-to-land exit mechanism: silazane oil replacement (already in Pool Genesis Hub §6.1–6.2). Does the cone rim provide a graduated ramp?
- [ ] Cognitive transition: when does meme architecture emerge? Is it lattice-dependent (grid-powered cognition) or independent?
- [ ] Does the depleting-pool environment drive merger behavior as a survival strategy? (Amorphs in the sealed pool face declining resources → merge to consolidate catalytic metals → proto-merge behavior.)

### Shore ecology (medium priority, framework exists)
- [ ] Full food web with energy flows and biomass estimates.
- [ ] Bilingual shore amorph social structure and economic role.
- [ ] Terminator vs. dark-side shore differentiation.
- [ ] Marine organisms evolving Schottky coupling to submerged lattice.

### Root landscape (lower priority)
- [ ] Root network patterns as geological archive.
- [ ] Collapse cascades and network fragmentation.
- [ ] Root rubble ecology.
- [ ] Ghost root submersion timeline.
