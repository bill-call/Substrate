# SESSION PROMPT — AMORPH DAILY LIFE HUB

**Output target:** `substrate_amorph_daily_life_hub.md` — New hub document.

**Load:** Spine (required). Amorph Emergence Hub. Amorph Economics Hub. Fauna Structural Hub. Memory Architecture Hub. Chemistry Hub §5 (electronic signaling), §8 (catalysis), §11 (library chemistry) on demand.

**Purpose:** Fill the ground-level texture gap. We have geology, towers, chemistry, and evolutionary pathways. We cannot yet build a scene. This document answers: what does it feel like to BE an amorph, in a specific place, at a specific point in history?

## STRUCTURE

The document is a matrix: **life domains × civilizational periods × geography**. Not every cell is populated — dark side is sparse early, day side is empty until period 4. Fill every populated cell with at least a paragraph. Depth where narratively urgent; skeleton where speculative.

### Civilizational Periods (columns)

| # | Period | Key character |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tower symbiote** | Biofilm/early free-range. Grid-dependent. No tools. Proto-cognition emerging at SiC percolation threshold. |
| 2 | **Hunter-gatherer** | Found-object tools/weapons. Dead-bug scavenging economy. First off-grid excursions. Observation-based learning from sexual organisms. |
| 3 | **Pre-industrial civilization** | Purpose-made tools. Population centers. Agriculture (battery organism farming, thorn-flower cultivation). Guilds/meme cartels. Active meme trade. Writing invented (monks, low-status). |
| 4 | **Industrial revolution** | Factory manufacturing. Metallurgy. Fiber composite. Day-side colonization begins. Corporate entities. Mass-produced engineered memes. Formal engineering. SiC LEDs. Shell economy collapsing. |
| 5 | **Space age** | Day-side power surplus. Mass driver. Probe program. Network merger in progress. Crisis visible. |

### Geography (depth axis, sparse)

| Zone | Populated when | Key differences from terminator |
|---|---|---|
| **Terminator** | All periods | Baseline. Ammonia rain, continuous lightning/thunder, towers everywhere, 240K, 9.5 m/s sustained wind, industrial and population center. |
| **Dark side** | Period 2+ (sparse settlers), monasteries period 3+ | Cold (215–240K), low wind (2–8 m/s), polished SiC bedrock, ammonia seas, sparse towers on gas pockets, silence, archaeological resources. Monks. |
| **Day side** | Period 4+ only | No liquid NH₃ (gas phase only — saturation pressure at 300K ≈ 10.6 bar > ~1 bar partial pressure; liquid requires pressure vessels). Active volcanism. Fluorine ecology. No large towers. 245–265K. Massive power surplus (solar + geothermal). Chronic petrification hazard. Hostile frontier. |

## LIFE DOMAIN ROWS

### Row 1: Hierarchy of Needs

Define the amorph Maslow pyramid and how it changes across periods. Established tiers:

| Tier | Need | Deprivation feel |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Survival | Charge, SiH₄, catalytic metals (Ni/Fe/Ti/Co), structural integrity, H₂O avoidance | ? |
| 2 — Safety | EM shelter (tower lattice = Faraday cage), wind shelter, Guard tolerance (IFF), thermal regulation, predator avoidance | ? |
| 3 — Social | Meme exchange, tower community access, reputation/standing | ? |
| 4 — Competence | Library depth, charge surplus, SiC stock, specialized skills | ? |
| 5 — Self-actualization | Budding (reproduction), merge (rare, destructive), understanding | ? |

**Questions to answer per period:** What does charge depletion feel like (cognitive degradation — getting dumber)? Is there a sleep analog? What is the daily activity cycle? How does the hierarchy shift as civilization advances (e.g., metal scarcity matters less with industrial supply chains)?

### Row 2: Locomotion

Established:
- **Crawling:** Peristaltic, 0.1–0.3 m/s, flat low-profile in wind. Primary mode all periods.
- **Sprint:** Burst from in-corpus power cells. 2–3 m/s, 2–3 minutes duration. Temporary rigidification of SiC stock into push-off structures. **Power-limited outdoors** (convective cooling handles 3500W waste heat at h≈75 W/m²·K; power cells drain in ~2–3 min). **Heat-limited indoors** (natural convection h≈25–35 W/m²·K; body reaches dangerous temps before power depletes). Post-sprint: find wind exposure → spread thin → cool → find charge point. Sprint is a survival response, not a commuting mode.
- **Root railway:** Grid-powered transit along conductive root surface. Local inter-tower.
- **Wind-surfing:** Passive, one-way day-ward. Deploy membrane, ride wind.
- **Ballooning:** H₂ lift 132 N/m³. Metabolic waste gas. Return path via upper-level return flow.

**Questions to answer per period:** When does each mode emerge? How does locomotion change with tool use (period 2+), constructed aids (period 3+), vehicles (period 4+)? Does the wheel-as-vehicle ever matter, or is it always a machine element only? Watercraft for amorphs that sink in ammonia (1050 vs 660 kg/m³)?

### Row 3: Transportation Networks

Not just modes — the SYSTEMS. Answer per period:

- Route topology between towers. Are there established paths? Marked routes?
- Root railway infrastructure: schedules, priority, congestion, capacity? Who controls access?
- Wind corridors as predictable one-way lanes. Established "highways"?
- Waypoints, rest stops, charging stations along routes.
- Bulk cargo movement. How do you move heavy goods when your strongest labor generates ~5 kPa? Domesticated haulers? Mechanical advantage tools? River/canal transport in ammonia drainage?
- Trade route networks: terminator ↔ day side, terminator ↔ dark side, shore routes.
- How do networks change with industrialization? Constructed infrastructure?

### Row 4: Carrying and Logistics

Established:
- **Internal (phagocytic):** Engulf in gel body. Small items, valuable items, currency (SiC plates carried internally).
- **External (adhesion):** Surface tension on gel surface. Temporary.
- **Manufactured containers:** SiC shells, woven fiber baskets/bags, composite vessels. Late period 2+.

**Questions:** What IS a tool for a gel organism? Probably internal carry + extrude when needed (a SiC blade held inside the body, extended through a pseudopod for use). What are the manufactured goods at each period? How does packaging/containerization evolve? What does a cargo shipment look like?

### Row 5: Shelter and Architecture

**Questions per period × geography:**

- What is a "room" for a shape-changer? Do they want enclosed spaces at all?
- Privacy is an EM shielding question, not line-of-sight. How is EM privacy achieved at each tech level? (Lattice = natural Faraday cage. Constructed: conductive SiC walls?)
- Acoustic environment matters (thunder-skin, 50 kHz hearing, Aeolian tone). Acoustic design?
- What does a settlement/city look like? Tower-interior carved spaces, lee-face accumulations, grown structures (extruded + ceramified), root-junction towns?
- Deposition zone residential (ancient stopped towers, deep sediment, low wind) — post-industrial only.
- Day-side outposts: what does a pioneer settlement look like with no towers, hostile environment?
- Dark-side monk monastery: gas-pocket tower, what's the physical space?
- "Architecture: grown not assembled. Extruded from body. Fiber composite post-revolution." (spine) — What does this look like in practice?

### Row 6: Feeding, Metabolism, and Thermoregulation

Established:
- Atmospheric SiH₄ = superabundant energy. Binding constraint is metabolic RATE and stored CHARGE.
- Dual storage: chemical (polysilane oil, slow) + electrical (semiconductor network, fast).
- Tower grid = fast charger. Atmospheric SiH₄ = slow baseline.
- Metabolic rate: 300W rest, 750W active, 5000W peak (100 kg reference).
- Thermoregulation: rest in shelter fine (+4–10K). Peak exertion in shelter dangerous (+78K). Behavioral rule: rest in shelter, exert in open.
- Ammonia evaporative cooling: 1370 J/g latent heat, 1–3 g/s at peak exertion. Liquid NH₃ unavailable day-side without pressure vessels.
- Day-side ammonia is an import good. Trade axis: terminator exports NH₃, day side exports power.

**Questions:** What does "eating" look like (atmospheric SiH₄ processing — passive? active inhalation?)? What does "drinking" look like (ammonia intake for cooling/solvent/nutrients)? Charging at a tower — the physical experience? Catalytic metal intake — dietary supplement equivalent? Factory thermal management (ammonia shower as industrial infrastructure, wet/dry zone separation)?

### Row 7: Social Life

**Questions per period:**
- Social unit: solitary, pair, group, community? How does this change?
- Daily cycle: is there one? (Tidally locked = no day/night cycle. Lightning provides irregular "weather." Tower energy might cycle?)
- Meme exchange as social bonding — touching someone to share a memory is intimate. How does casual social contact work? Handshake equivalent?
- Merge social dynamics — when, why, with whom? Taboos? Who initiates?
- Budding social dynamics — when is an amorph "ready"? Social pressure? Economic readiness?
- Population density by zone and period.
- EM environment as social environment — you can sense everyone nearby thinking. What does a crowd feel like?

### Row 8: Economy and Commerce

Established:
- Dual currency: stored charge (cash, perishable) + SiC plates (gold, permanent). Shell economy collapses period 4.
- Three-layer economy: charge, material goods, meme IP.
- Meme as commercial product. Dependency graphs as DRM/skill trees.
- Battery organisms as first domesticated species / livestock.
- Farmer caste → surplus → specialization → trade.

**Questions per period:**
- What's for sale at each civilizational stage? What IS a store/market?
- Meme retail: physical transaction (gel contact, seconds). What's the retail space?
- Quality tiers: premium (source fidelity) vs commodity (nth-generation copies).
- What are the manufactured goods? (Period 3: purpose-made SiC tools, fiber items. Period 4: metallurgical products, composite structures, engineered memes, LEDs, optical instruments.)
- Regional trade goods: day-side exports (fluorine products, metals, fissile materials, power). Terminator exports (liquid NH₃, manufactured goods, population/labor). Dark-side exports (marine products — glass, concentrated H₂O, Tesla valves, anti-petrification biochemistry, purification organisms).
- Wartime economics: ammonia embargo as siege weapon. Fluorine as counter-leverage (taboo). Three-region flechette supply chain (glass = dark-side marine, fluorine = day-side volcanic, metal doping = conductivity for EM launch).

### Row 9: Governance, Legal Systems, and Labor

Established:
- Governance evolution: consensus-by-merge → designated dissenters → lattice-shielded argument chambers → written constitutions.
- Meme provenance is molecular (attribution solved by physics).
- Copying is biological default (budding, merge transfer everything).
- Monks can read meme structure = lie detection, forensics, IP verification.
- Corporate personhood is a NECESSITY (individual identity too unstable for durable contracts).

**Key resolved decisions from this session:**
- **Guild = meme cartel.** Controls vocational meme stacks. Apprenticeship = incremental meme access. Identical to human guild economics.
- **Meme dependency graphs are deliberately engineered as IP defense.** Monolithic skill-meme = single point of theft. Fragmented dependency graph = guild controls the topology. Skill trees are DRM, not pedagogy.
- **Practitioners are prisoners.** Anyone running the complete stack is a walking IP leak. Guild restricts their contact, budding, and absolutely forbids merge. Defection met with lethal force.
- **Two-tier labor:** Blue-collar (routine practitioners, interchangeable, zero leverage — the meme stack runs identically on any body) vs white-collar (innovators, unique SiC topology produces novel insights, irreplaceable, gilded cage). Genius exists in topology, not library.
- **Narrative decision: individual talent matters.** Idempotency is real for routine execution. Genius exists in SiC network topology and is narratively significant for innovation, creativity, and out-of-context problem solving.

**Questions per period:**
- Dispute resolution mechanics at each stage.
- IP law evolution: informal norms → guild enforcement → corporate law → statutory.
- Identity law: liability after merge/bud. Criminal liability when the perpetrator no longer exists.
- Molecular testimony: Monk-examined memory as evidence. Two-tier justice (Monk access = expensive).
- Lattice-shielded courts (EM-private deliberation).
- Labor movements: is collective action possible against replaceable-worker economics? What form does resistance take?
- Monk role: quality certification (FDA analog), forensic testimony, counterweight to corporate power, uncomfortable dual role as both guardian and potential IP threat.
- **Guild retirement/expulsion mechanics:** Universal meme-destroying phage (cleaves polysilane meme backbone generically — simpler to engineer than targeted phage). Retirement = factory reset: broker copies personal memes to escrow → universal phage wipes ALL memes → broker reinstalls personal memes (one generation degraded). The member is conscious through the wipe (SiC hardware still runs). Same tool for punishment: wipe without restore = identity erasure, body survives. The guild possesses a weapon of mass identity destruction and calls it "HR."
- **Retirement mechanics are native biology + phage.** Meme transfer is a normal amorph capability (selective gel-contact copy — parents do it during budding). Process: (1) member transfers ALL memes to broker via gel contact, (2) universal phage wipes all memes from member's body, (3) broker transfers back only non-guild memes (withholds guild IP). Broker's role is administrative (knows which provenance signatures are guild property), not technical. No Monk-adjacent skills needed. The phage is the only specialized tool.
- **The retirement option exists because of the artisans.** Line workers are fungible (defector gets a fluorine dart, replacement budded by Tuesday). But genius cannot be recruited into a system where the only exit is murder. The retirement process is the minimum viable recruiting incentive for irreplaceable topology-dependent innovators.
- **Guild internal structure (minimum):** Practitioners (blue-collar, fungible), artisans (white-collar, topology-dependent genius), graph architects (know the dependency topology), brokers (escrow + phage access — HR, not technicians). Escalating trust levels and captivity.

### Row 10: Aesthetics and Art

Amorph senses, ranked by primacy:
1. **EM field** — primary world-model sense. Detects all thinking organisms. Tower lattice hum. Network signals.
2. **Chemical** — ppb sensitivity downwind. Orders of magnitude beyond human olfaction.
3. **Piezoelectric/tactile** — whole-body mechanosensation via gel + SiC.
4. **Acoustic** — to 50 kHz. Thunder-skin dedicated processor. Aeolian tone perception.
5. **Vision** — secondary. Parabolic reflector eye (meme-transferable). Adjustable aperture/focal length. Near-IR optimized (star peak 850nm). No vision defects (reshape reflector).

Established art forms (spine): public (sculptural, wind-song, bioluminescent, architecture), private (curated merge — audience lives the artwork).

**Questions:**
- What does beauty mean to an organism whose primary sense is EM? Beautiful EM patterns? Cognitive signatures that feel elegant to be near?
- Chemical art (perfumery at ppb complexity). Compositions, signatures, ambient environments.
- Acoustic art beyond wind-song. Ultrasonic compositions. Thunder-frequency percussion.
- Visual art — secondary sense but capable. Near-IR palette. What does their visual aesthetic emphasize?
- Curated merge as art form — the audience LIVES the artwork. How is this performed? Composed? Reviewed? Is there a performing art tradition?
- Comedy, drama, literature (low-status written form, but does it exist)?
- How does art evolve across periods? Period 1 has none. Period 2? When does aesthetic awareness emerge?
- What does a civilized amorph consider beautiful in architecture? In another person? In landscape?

### Row 11: Ground-Level Ecology

The biggest gap. Bible §9.3 has five lines on primary producers. "Ground film pioneers" is the entire ground cover model.

**Questions:**
- What is the ground cover at the terminator? Biofilm on rock? Sessile organisms? Nothing?
- Root ecology: what lives on/near/in surface roots? Is there a root-adjacent ecosystem?
- Rain environment: what happens when ammonia rain hits the ground? Puddles? Runoff channels? What lives in ephemeral rain pools?
- Small organisms in the inter-tower space: what's there? The spine says inter-tower gaps are EM killing fields — but something must survive.
- Debris environment: dead-bug plume material, grit, volcanic ash. What accumulates where? What lives in the accumulations?
- Dark-side ground: polished SiC bedrock. What lives on it? Anything?
- Day-side ground: volcanic terrain. Fluorine ecology dominates. What does the ground look like?
- Shore/intertidal: richest marine zone (spine). What's the ground-level experience of a shoreline?
- What do you SEE (sense) standing at ground level between two towers? Describe the sensory environment: EM signatures, wind, sound, chemical landscape, visual scene.

## STANDALONE BLOCKS

### A. Meme Industry Lifecycle

Trace the full arc: artisanal meme crafting (observation-based, period 2) → guild meme cartels (controlled stacks, period 3) → corporate meme manufacturing (engineered, dependency-graphed, period 4) → platform competition and lock-in (period 4–5). Include the Monk role (certification, quality assurance, uncomfortable dual-use as potential IP threat).

### B. City Morphology

What does a settlement look like at each period × geography combination? Tower-interior carved spaces, lee-face accumulations, root-junction towns, grown/extruded structures, deposition-zone residential (post-industrial). Day-side outposts. Dark-side monasteries. The physical form of amorph civilization.

### C. Legal System Deep Dive

Consensus-by-merge (judicial suicide producing a Solomon) → guild arbitration → corporate law → written constitutions (Monk-attested). Molecular testimony. Identity law across merge/bud events. The emergence of corporate personhood as practical necessity. IP enforcement mechanics.

### D. Transportation Evolution

Full arc by period: crawling only → root railway → wind-surfing → ballooning → watercraft? → cargo systems → constructed vehicles → mass driver. Network topology at each stage. Infrastructure investment. Who controls the routes?

## RESOLVED PHYSICS AND DECISIONS (context — do not re-derive)

- Thermoregulation: h≈75 W/m²·K forced (open), h≈25–35 natural (sheltered). Rest +4–10K, peak +31K open / +78K sheltered.
- Sprint: 2–3 m/s, 2–3 min, power-limited outdoors, heat-limited indoors.
- Ammonia cooling: 1370 J/g evaporative. Liquid NH₃ unavailable day-side.
- Regional monopolies: day (fluorine, metals, fissile, power), terminator (liquid NH₃, manufacturing, population), dark (marine products).
- Flechette weapon: metal-doped glass needle + fluorine, three-region supply chain, anti-amorph design (tumbles in gel, distributes fluorine along curved wound track, merge-contagious).
- Meme dependency graphs: YES. Mechanism is economic (guild IP defense via deliberate fragmentation) AND technical (complex skills calling sub-skills). Skill trees are DRM.
- Labor stratification: blue-collar (routine, replaceable) vs white-collar (topology-dependent genius, irreplaceable). Genius exists in SiC topology, not meme library.
- Corporate personhood: necessity, not fiction. Individual identity too unstable for durable contracts.
- Guild → corporation evolution parallels human history. Guild = meme cartel. Practitioners are prisoners (complete-stack carriers are IP leak risks).

## OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

- Fill every populated matrix cell with at least a paragraph.
- Flag cells where the answer is genuinely uncertain as □ OPEN with the specific question.
- Flag cells where the answer contradicts or extends existing canon with ⚠ and the specific tension.
- Cross-reference to existing hubs/spine where established material is being applied.
- Maintain the distinction between resolved decisions (✓), working assumptions, and open questions (□).

*What does an amorph Tuesday look like?*
