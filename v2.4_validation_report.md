# Substrate v2.4 — Validation Report

## Executive Summary

The v2.4 canon is physically robust. All six physics checks passed or raised only minor bookkeeping concerns — no fundamental implausibilities were found. Cross-document consistency is strong after the v2.2 reconciliation, with one actionable terminology failure ("parasite" → "mutualist" not yet patched in three active files). The main weaknesses are narrative-blocking gaps: the working memory collapse mechanism is entirely unspecified, social prerequisites for civilization lack staging, and shore ecology is asserted as "richest zone" without supporting detail.

## Critical Issues

| Source | Item | Detail |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Agent B** | **"Parasite" terminology — FAIL** | `substrate_bible.md:1885`, `substrate_fauna_hub.md:62,1160`, and `CLAUDE.md:55` still call middle-kingdom symbiotes "parasites." Resolved canon is "mutualists." The fauna structural hub explicitly flags this as wrong (line 326) but source texts were never patched. **Fix: search-and-replace in three files.** |
| **Agent C** | **Working memory ceiling — MISSING** | "Single-network communication collapse" appears in spine and bible as flat assertion. No physics anywhere — not in Memory Architecture Hub, not in Economics Hub. Federation "bypasses" it but the bypass is equally unspecified. **Narrative-blocking:** federation is the monks' defining capability and enables probe library compilation. |

## Concerns

| Source | Item | Detail |
|--------|------|--------|
| Agent A | **Drifter cycle timing** | Venturi aerodynamics solid (Re ~5×10⁶). But phase durations at stated wind speeds imply organisms traverse less than full hemispheric distances (dark-side transit: 2-8 m/s × 5-7 days = ~2,600 km vs ~15,000 km quarter-circumference). Works if organisms ride altitude-variable winds and S-curve Coriolis shortcuts. **Fix: add one clarifying sentence.** |
| Agent A | **Boundary layer Re** | Calculated Re ~10¹³, spine says ~10¹². Conservative — not wrong, but could be tightened. Low priority. |
| Agent B | **"Laminar" in simulation prompts** | Three copies of `substrate_tower_simulation_prompt` say "Steady, laminar" for dark-side wind. Working docs, not canon, but could propagate error. |
| Agent C | **Social prerequisites — PARTIAL** | Governance, economy, religion all listed but not staged against each other. No prerequisite chain (farmer caste → battery domestication → shell economy → ?). **Narrative-blocking** for any civilization-focused scene. |
| Agent C | **Shore ecology — PARTIAL** | "Richest marine zone" asserted without species, food web, or biomass. Only named organism with shore relevance is medusa-fish mobile reef. Bible open questions already flag this. **Narrative-blocking** for shore scenes. |
| Agent C | **Skywhale metabolism — PARTIAL** | Three-phase cycle qualitatively compelling but numerically unvalidated. No power budget for propulsion, sea-dip cost in 1.82g, or cycle timing. Conspicuous given how thoroughly thorn-flora energy was quantified. |
| Agent C | **Energy budget derivation — PARTIAL** | 300W rest / 1 kg/hr SiH₄ asserted but thermodynamic link (reaction enthalpy × efficiency = watts) never shown. The 1,300:1 delivery surplus makes the budget clearly closeable, but the derivation is implicit. |
| Agent C | **Merge data transfer — PARTIAL** | "Combined meme pool" is narrative assertion without molecular-level mechanism. What happens to incompatible addressing schemes? |
| Agent C | **Gas intake scaling — PARTIAL** | M^0.85 scaling asserted without diffusion-geometry model. Small organisms have no metabolic budget at all. |
| Agent C | **Middle kingdom taxonomy — PARTIAL** | Functional roles named but no species diversity within roles, no food web, no placement in the 5-zone lattice flow model. |

## Passes

**Physics (Agent A):** Atmospheric conveyor grain-size filter, SiC abrasion peneplain, boundary layer terminology, marine physics (H₂O partitioning, Tesla valve, EM broadcast in high-dielectric NH₃), thermal kill zone hierarchy.

**Consistency (Agent B):** Atmospheric parameters (all docs aligned), tower-dependent seas, genesis environment, network wars + plume timing, colonization mechanism + cross-refs, speciation axes (2 amorph / 4 middle kingdom). Siloxane terminology clean in active docs.

**Completeness (Agent C):** Thorn-flora energy budget (fully quantified, both sources), warfare supply chain (3-stage fluorine, iodine laser regeneration, railgun pathway).

## Recommended Next Sessions (Prioritized)

1. **Working memory collapse + federation physics.** Define the failure mode (cross-talk? thermal? capacitive?) and federation bypass architecture. Narrative-blocking for monks arc and probe arc.

2. **Civilization prerequisite chain.** Stage farmer caste, battery domestication, shell economy, governance forms, and writing against each other. Narrative-blocking for any civilization scene.

3. **Shore ecology buildout.** Species, food web, biomass estimates for the "richest zone." Narrative-blocking for shore/bilingual-community scenes.

4. **Skywhale energy budget.** Quantify propulsion power, sea-dip cost, cycle timing. Match the rigor already applied to thorn-flora.

5. **Terminology patch.** Search-and-replace "parasite" → "mutualist" in bible, fauna hub, CLAUDE.md. Fix "laminar" in simulation prompts. 15-minute task.
