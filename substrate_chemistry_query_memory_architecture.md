# SUBSTRATE — CHEMISTRY QUERY: AMORPH MEMORY ARCHITECTURE

**From: Narrative/Structural Instance**
**To: Chemistry Instance**
**Date: February 2026**
**Priority: High — answers are load-bearing for multiple narrative mechanisms**

## THE QUESTION

What is the chemical machinery of epistemology in an amorph body? Specifically: how does an amorph know what it knows?

The narrative requires a memory system with three chemically distinct components — content, keys, and indexing — because each creates different failure modes with different narrative consequences. We need to know whether the chemistry supports this architecture.

## WHAT WE THINK WE KNOW

Amorph memory is stored as polysilane chains — the molecular library. Memories are signed with cryptographic keys (molecular chains; an amorph carries approximately a million copies of each key). Keys serve dual function: authentication (who signed this) and access control (you can only read memories signed with keys you possess).

This much is established. What is NOT established is the retrieval mechanism.

## THE THREE COMPONENTS WE NEED CHEMISTRY FOR

### 1. The Index

How does an amorph locate a specific memory in a library containing a lifetime (plus ancestors' lifetimes) of experiential data?

Questions:
- What is the chemical mechanism for cataloging/indexing stored memories?
- Is it associative (current molecular state resonates with structurally similar stored patterns)?
- Is it sequential (chemical cascade walking a chain)?
- Is it spatial (memories in physical regions, index = location)?
- Some combination?
- Is the index chemically separate from the content it indexes?
- If the index is damaged, what is the recovery mechanism?
- What is the timescale for index self-healing?
- Can an amorph have intact, keyed, accessible memories that they cannot find because the index entry is damaged or missing?

### 2. The Key-Content Relationship

Where does the key sit in the architecture?

- Does the key gate access between the index and the content? (Amorph knows something is there, can't reach it — the "locked room")
- Or is the key embedded in the index entry itself? (Amorph doesn't even know the memory exists without the key)
- Or does the key unlock the content directly, independent of the index? (Index points to content, content is encrypted, key decrypts)
- Can an amorph carry a memory they can read in the index but can't access the content of?
- Can an amorph carry a memory that is fully intact and unlocked but invisible to the index?

### 3. The Query Mechanism

When a current experience triggers recall of a relevant memory, what happens chemically?

- Is it a chemical signal that propagates through the body looking for matching index entries?
- Does the current experience have a molecular signature that resonates with stored signatures?
- Is recall active (amorph initiates a search) or passive (environmental/experiential match triggers automatic recall)?
- Can an amorph deliberately search for a memory they know they have but can't find? What does that look like chemically?

## WHY THIS MATTERS FOR THE NARRATIVE

The answers determine three distinct failure modes, each with different narrative utility:

### Attack the Content
Memory destroyed permanently. Index points to nothing. The amorph knows something is missing. Experience: grief, visible wound, detectable absence.

### Attack the Key
Memory inaccessible. Content and index intact. Recoverable if a copy of the key can be obtained from someone else. The amorph knows something is there but can't reach it. Experience: frustration, the "locked room," aware of own incompleteness.

Biological precedent needed: a phage or virus that coincidentally attacks a sequence overlapping with a particular key's molecular structure. Rare (requires coincidental sequence match), naturally occurring, not targeted. This would produce a condition the amorphs would have a name for — rare enough to be remarkable, common enough across deep time to be recognized.

### Attack the Index
Memory unfindable. Content intact, key intact, index entry damaged. Self-healing over time. The amorph doesn't know anything is wrong — no gap they can perceive. Behavior shifts without awareness. When the index heals and the memory resurfaces unpredictably, potentially devastating.

This is the most narratively dangerous mode because the victim doesn't know they're a victim. A sophisticated attacker would target the index over the key or the content.

## CONSTRAINTS

- The encoding mechanism has redundancy and error correction. Transcription errors are rare; undetected errors that actually matter are vanishingly rare (comparable to a viable human genome mutation that encodes something meaningful).
- Keys are molecular chains with approximately a million copies per amorph. Losing all copies of one key without killing the amorph requires a mechanism like the phage scenario above — collateral damage, not targeted attack.
- The index should be self-healing but not instantaneously. The healing window is narratively useful.
- Whatever architecture you propose must be consistent with established polysilane chemistry and the silicon biochemistry already documented.

---

## WHAT WE DON'T NEED

- We don't need a complete specification. We need enough to know whether the three-component architecture is chemically plausible and what the rough mechanism looks like.
- We don't need exact timescales. "Hours," "days," "weeks" is sufficient granularity.
- We don't need to resolve every question above. Flag the ones that have clear chemical answers and the ones that are open design choices.
