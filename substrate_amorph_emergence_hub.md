# SUBSTRATE — AMORPH EMERGENCE HUB

**v2.4 — February 2026**

**Load with:** Spine (required). Pool Genesis Hub (context for Stage 0). Memory Architecture Hub (context for IFF → key system trajectory). Fauna Structural Hub (optional, for body plan details). Amorph Economics Hub (optional, for charge economy details).

The pathway from pool-dwelling micro-organism to free-range megafauna. Continuous, inevitable given My-scale opportunity, energy-closed at every stage. No miraculous leaps.

## 1. OVERVIEW

Six stages, overlapping in time. Population distributed across all stages simultaneously once the conveyor is established. Cognition emerges from physics (SiC semiconductor percolation), not evolution. Competitive pressure from sexual Miners is the engine that drives range extension, body size increase, and eventually the full megafauna phenotype.

---

## 2. STAGE 0: POOL GENESIS (My-scale)

Open terminator ammonia pool. Non-fracture-connected (fracture-connected pools fill with lattice in years–decades; genesis requires My-scale stability). Pool in monadnock depression or geological basin near SiH₄ source. Adjacent terrain: dead SiC (monadnock) or silicate bedrock — not active lattice (active lattice consumes pools: pool is full of solvent, fuel, and building materials).

**Organism:** ≤100 μm coacervate. Metallosilazane catalytic chemistry. No fixed body plan. No genome. Chelation chemistry present (ancestral — metal-mining from catalytic PCS fragments). Minimal cognition.

**Energy:** Chemical. Metallosilazane catalysis on dissolved SiH₄. Diffusion-limited size ceiling at ~100 μm.

Coacervation produces proto-amorphs; amphiphile self-assembly produces proto-sexuals (dual-origin fork, see Pool Genesis Hub §4).

---

## 3. STAGE 1: AEROPLANKTON DISPERSAL (continuous)

Pool organisms reach atmosphere via rain splash, wind shear, evaporative margin exposure.

**Physics:** At 8 bar, gas density ~8.1 kg/m³. Stokes settling velocity for 100 μm particle (ρ_p ≈ 1200 kg/m³): ~1 mm/s. Wind at 9.5 m/s → wind-to-settling ratio ~10⁴. Travel distances 10–100+ km.

**Mechanism:** Random deposition across terminator belt. No directed migration, no taxis, no sensing. Survival selection only.

- **Silicate bedrock:** survive at ≤100 μm on dissolved SiH₄ in rain film. Cannot grow. In transit until next wind event or death.
- **Dead monadnock SiC:** persist. Cannot grow (no grid power).
- **Living tower exterior:** grid power via Schottky coupling. Growth possible → Stage 2.

---

## 4. STAGE 2: TOWER BIOFILM (ky-scale establishment)

Micro-amorph deposited on tower exterior dead crust. Tower is My-old (same geological feature produced tower and nearby genesis pool). Likely colonized by early sexual organisms (genomic evolution faster than meme evolution) — simple sessile community, no specialized guilds yet. No Guards. No Miners.

**Grid coupling:** Metallosilazane enzyme metal centers (Ti optimal, near-ohmic) contact N:SiC → Schottky junction → grid power extraction. Scales with contact area.

**Growth:** Grid power breaks diffusion ceiling. Contact area → power → growth → more contact area. Positive feedback.

**Mining function — amorphs as first miners:** Biofilm chelates metals from wind-deposited debris (volcanic ash, dust, glow-snow residue) and concentrates on lattice surface where living coral layer absorbs them. Same ancestral chelation chemistry from pool genesis. Net positive tower feedback: metal delivery to living layer. Tower doesn't care about efficiency — any delivery produces positive feedback proportional to the signal.

**SiC accumulation:** Biofilm incorporates SiC from dead-bug plume debris, lattice fragments, environmental deposition. Stock grows with organism size and residence time.

**Proto-cognition emergence:** At SiC percolation threshold, semiconductor network achieves signal integration — pattern detection, short-term memory, sensory integration. Physics, not evolution: SiC junction networks process signals because that is what semiconductor junctions do when current flows through them. Depends on SiC volume fraction and network topology within the body, not absolute body size. Can occur during the biofilm stage for organisms that have accumulated sufficient SiC.

---

## 5. STAGE 3: GUARD COEVOLUTION AND FIRST MEME (My-scale, overlaps Stage 2)

Guard function evolves in sexual symbiote lineage (surface quality control). Guards attack unrecognized organisms via chelation kill mode.

**IFF imprinting:** Long-resident biofilm passively acquires lattice surface chemistry (dopant profile, polytype signature, trace metal ratios). Guards' molecular recognition reads "local lattice" → no attack. Time-gated: fresh arrivals vulnerable until imprinted. Network-specific: foreign tower imprint doesn't match local lattice chemistry.

**First meme:** New amorph arrives → contacts established resident biofilm → gel-gel surface contact → IFF signature transfers. Proof-of-residence. Survival-selected molecular pattern transfer between organisms. The transfer mechanism is ancestral — coacervate coalescence from pool genesis. Same gel-contact chemistry generalizes to all subsequent meme exchange.

**IFF → key system trajectory:** IFF chemistry is structurally identical to the memory architecture key mechanism (allosteric molecular recognition gating enzyme behavior). Keys descend from IFF chemistry. Key exchange during merge descends from IFF contact exchange. Evolutionary trajectory: proof-of-residence → network membership → library signature → individual identity.

---

## 6. STAGE 4: MINER COMPETITION AND RANGE EXTENSION (My-scale, overlaps Stage 3)

Sexual Miners (ants) evolve: genomically optimized, root-mobile (Schottky-couple along conductive root surface), crevice-adapted (enter active fracture networks lined with harvestable metals). Outcompete amorphs on motility, throughput, and access to richest sources.

**Proportional displacement:** Tower feedback is proportional, not tournament. Less efficient mining → less reward, not zero. Amorph population contracts but persists. Net positive remains net positive. The tower does not compare suppliers.

**Competitive pressure drives:**

1. **Range extension.** Mine further from tower center. Access off-grid terrain with stored charge. Ants go anywhere the grid goes; amorphs can go where the grid doesn't.
2. **Body size increase.** Bigger → more charge storage → longer off-grid range → access to uncompeted resources. Growth selected by range economics.
3. **Observation-based learning.** Amorphs watch sexual organisms (ants, Guards, Healers) and replicate behaviors adapted to gel physiology, then encode as transferable memes. Sexual organisms = innovation engine (fast genomic evolution). Amorphs = technology transfer layer (observe, adapt, encode, distribute). Meme crafting from observation is categorically different from meme transcription errors — it is intentional, requires proto-cognition (SiC percolation threshold must already be crossed), and produces novel memes at a rate decoupled from transcription-error frequency.
4. **Brain growth.** The cognitive molecular machine is a material: manufacture more of it. More SiC semiconductor network = more signal processing capacity. Single-node ceiling determined by information-processing topology (edge-traversal costs exceed benefit of adding new nodes), not metabolism. With electronic signaling at 100–2000× biological neuron speed, ceiling is at least human-equivalent general intelligence.

**Mobility modes emerge:**

- **Root railway:** Grid-powered transit along conductive root. Local inter-tower. Same IFF/Guard protection as on tower.
- **Downwind advection:** Passive, one-way, day-ward. Deploy membrane, ride wind.
- **Peristaltic crawling:** 0.1–0.3 m/s, any direction. Energetically feasible for short off-grid excursions. Exposed (EM killing field between towers).
- **Atmospheric circuit (later):** Ride wind to substellar chimney → superstream return → dark-side surface. Planetary-scale. Semelparous propagule variant possible (release propagules at chimney, parent dies).

**Energy transition:** Grid-coupled on tower and root (charging). Stored charge off-grid (discharging). Return-to-charge cycle begins. Charge economy established.

---

## 7. STAGE 5: FREE-RANGE MEGAFAUNA (continuous development)

**Body:** kg-scale+. Variable rigidity (redistributable SiC stock). Gel actuators (~5 kPa). Silane/silazane gel + silazane oil.

**Sensory:** Parabolic reflector eye (meme-transferable). EM field primary sense. Piezoelectric vibration. Chemical ppb downwind. Thunder-skin (ancient universal meme).

**Cognition:** Semiconductor neurology at electronic speed. Parallel associative memory (resonance-based, entire library searched simultaneously). Native arithmetic/Bayesian. Growable working memory. Observation-based learning. Single-node ceiling ≥ human-equivalent. Federation (monks only, much later) exceeds ceiling.

**Getting smarter:** Amorphs do not evolve smarter — they accumulate smarter. Individual ontogeny (lifetime SiC accumulation + meme acquisition from neighbors) is the primary mechanism. Lamarckian inheritance via budding: buds receive fraction of parent's accumulated SiC + selected memes, starting further along the accumulation curve. Meme pool improves slowly via transcription errors + selection. Observation-based meme crafting accelerates skill acquisition beyond transcription-error rate by piggybacking on sexual organisms' genomic innovation.

**Meme library:** Deep, broad. Accumulated techniques copied from every observed specialist guild. Signed IP with provenance metadata. Transmissible via budding (selective) and gel-contact transfer (horizontal).

**Tower mutualism (mature):** Amorphs = long-range logistics and intelligence layer. Deliver off-grid materials. Manage tower health via energy-gradient tropism (differential charging behavior based on tower condition). Tower provides fast electrical recharge (vs slow atmospheric SiH₄ baseline). Economic relationship = power delivery rate.

**Population structure:** Original biofilm lineage persists on tower in reduced role. Free-range lineage radiates. Farmer caste (surplus reward → battery organisms → trade → specialization). Dual currency (charge + SiC plates).

---

## 8. IDEMPOTENCY

An amorph body is chemically uniform (no genome → no biological individuality). Two "blank" bodies loaded with identical meme sets produce approximately the same individual. Same memories, same skills, same personality at t=0.

**Non-idempotent factors:**

1. **SiC network topology.** Unique to each body's growth history. Different accumulation paths → different junction arrangements → different signal propagation, association chains, and retrieval priorities. Cognitive "style," not cognitive content.
2. **Working memory state.** Volatile active processing — not meme-encoded. Diverges from first sensory input at startup.
3. **Spatial meme distribution.** Physical layout within gel affects retrieval order (signal attenuation → nearby memes retrieved faster).

**Result:** Idempotent at social-identity level (others recognize both as "same person"). Not idempotent at subjective-experience level (different cognitive style, different trains of thought from first moment).

**Implications for reproduction:**

- **Budding:** Bud inherits memes + SiC fraction but builds own topology → similar-but-not-identical offspring. More like a child with the parent's diary than a clone.
- **Merge (N→1):** Destroys original SiC topologies, creates novel architecture reading combined library. Neither parent's processing style survives intact. Genuinely new mind.
