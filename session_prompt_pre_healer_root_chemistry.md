# Session Prompt: Pre-Healer Root Growth Chemistry

## Load Order

1. CLAUDE.md (session protocol)
2. substrate_spine.md (hard constraints)
3. substrate_silicon_chemistry_hub.md (primary reference — this is the chemistry session)
4. substrate_tower_morphology_hub.md §2 and §11.3 (growth phases, collection modes)
5. substrate_root_propagation_notes.md §4d, §6a, §6b (PCS gap, Healer root model, root barriers)

## Context

We have two open questions on the tower morphology hub that both sit at the catalytic-to-symbiote transition:

**Q5: Is the original catalytic surface dead in modern towers?**
**Q7: What mechanism builds roots before Healers exist?**

The architectural answer is worked out (morphology hub, tower hub). What's missing is the **actual chemistry** for pre-Healer root growth at the surface.

## What We Know (established canon)

1. **Deep-rock reaction front** operates at geothermal temperatures (400–600°C with biological metallosilazane catalysts, per root propagation notes line 129). Core reaction: SiH₄ + CH₄ → SiC + 4H₂, ΔH = −33 kJ/mol. Self-propagating through fractures. Metallosilazane catalytic sites (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co) embedded in the N:SiC product.

2. **Proto-tower growth (Phase 1)** is autocatalytic mineral accretion. Lightning forges PCS/organosilicon molecules via PECVD in the atmosphere. These deposit on the catalytic N:SiC surface and are ceramified. The surface is itself catalytic — reaction self-propagates upward. Lightning also does direct PECVD on the tower surface.

3. **PCS gap** forces lateral surface roots for grounding. Lightning ceramifies from above (I²R heating), geothermal from below. Kilometers of insulating PCS between fronts. Tower must dump excess charge laterally → needs surface roots. (Root propagation notes §4d.)

4. **Modern roots** are Healer-built via arc-CVD, directed by network energy gradients. Feedstock: atmospheric SiH₄. Energy: tower grid (lightning). This is well-understood and not in question.

5. **Catalytic metals** (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co) are kinetically scarce at the surface (economics hub §5). All metabolism requires them. The deep-rock system has them (deposited during geological advance through metal-bearing rock). Surface availability is the population limiter.

6. **Surface temperature** is ~240K at the terminator. Deep-rock catalysis needs 400–600°C even with biological catalysts.

## The Specific Problem

The proto-tower needs lateral surface roots for grounding (PCS gap constraint). Modern roots are Healer-built (arc-CVD). But Healers haven't evolved yet in Phase 1. What chemistry builds the first roots?

The architectural model proposes: "catalytic surface chemistry running laterally along deep-rock fracture templates exposed at the monadnock surface." Lightning current flowing through these conductive N:SiC strips provides activation energy; atmospheric PECVD provides molecular feedstock; the metallosilazane catalytic sites in the original deep-rock N:SiC propagate the reaction.

**But this is chemically unspecified.** The critical gap:

- The deep-rock reaction runs at 400–600°C (geothermal). The surface is 240K. Can the same catalytic chemistry operate at surface temperature? If not, what chemistry CAN?
- Lightning I²R heating at the root tip: plausible near the tower base, but how far can current density sustain useful temperatures along a thin surface root? Does this set a maximum root extension rate?
- What specifically happens at the growing root tip? Is it: (a) catalytic ceramification of deposited atmospheric molecules (like the tower surface), (b) I²R-heated local PECVD on the conductive root surface, (c) some lower-temperature polymerization that later ceramifies, (d) something else?
- What carries the catalytic activity? (Root propagation notes line 24: open question — thin silazane polymer film? Free catalytic complexes? Self-regenerating catalytic coating?)
- Is the rate limited by metal availability for new catalytic sites (as proposed), by I²R heating range, by molecular feedstock delivery, or by something else?

## What "Resolved" Looks Like

1. A specific chemical mechanism (or short sequence of mechanisms) for pre-Healer root extension at surface conditions.
2. Identification of the rate-limiting step and approximate growth rate.
3. Whether this mechanism produces catalytic N:SiC (self-propagating) or non-catalytic SiC/SiCN (terminal without further metal input).
4. Maximum root extension distance from the tower base (set by I²R heating range, metal availability, or other constraint).
5. Clean transition model: how does this mechanism hand off to Healer-built roots as symbiotes evolve? (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 continuity.)

## Secondary Question (depends on root chemistry answer)

**Q5: Catalytic surface status in modern towers.**

Working hypothesis: Ship of Theseus renewal replaced all original catalytic N:SiC (metallosilazane-site-bearing) with Healer-deposited SiCN (no catalytic sites). Therefore:

- Catalytic surface is definitively dead in fully-renewed towers.
- Crisis degradation is irreversible past Ship of Theseus — tower cannot revert to catalytic growth.
- "Reaction front only" in the aliveness spectrum is an early-life state, not a degradation state.

**Validate or challenge this based on the root chemistry findings.** Specifically: does Healer SiCN actually lack catalytic activity, or could it support some autocatalytic reaction? Does the chemistry of the Healer deposit differ enough from the deep-rock deposit to guarantee the catalytic surface is dead?

## Constraints

- All chemistry must be grounded in real organosilicon chemistry or clearly flagged as speculative.
- The chemistry hub (substrate_silicon_chemistry_hub.md) is the primary reference for established chemistry.
- Do not invent new atmospheric species or reactions that contradict the chemistry hub inventory.
- The atmosphere is: N₂ 55%, H₂ 15%, NH₃ 12.5%, CH₄ 10%, He+Ar ~7%, SiH₄ 0.3%. 8 bar total. 240K at terminator.
- Reducing atmosphere. No O₂. Native metals stable. H₂O is trace and hostile (petrification).

## Output

- Resolved chemistry for pre-Healer root growth (or a clear statement that it can't work and why).
- Updated entries for the morphology hub open questions §13.5 and §13.7.
- Any new constraints or corrections to propagate to spine/bible/chemistry hub.
