## 2. HIERARCHY OF NEEDS

### 2.1 The Amorph Maslow

| Tier | Need | Deprivation experience |
|------|------|----------------------|
| 1 — Survival | Charge, SiH₄ access, structural SiC integrity, H₂O avoidance | Cognitive narrowing (load-shedding), then torpor, then death |
| 2 — Safety | EM shelter (tower lattice), wind shelter, Guard tolerance (IFF), thermal regulation, predator avoidance | Anxiety: constant EM exposure = feeling watched. Thunder damage. Burn risk. |
| 3 — Social | Meme exchange, tower community access, reputation/standing | Isolation degrades meme library (no refresh, transcription errors accumulate uncorrected). Stagnation. |
| 4 — Competence | Library depth, charge surplus, SiC stock, specialized skills | Status anxiety. Unable to earn tower reward efficiently. Economic marginalisation. |
| 5 — Self-actualization | Budding (reproduction), merge (rare, destructive), understanding | Unfulfilled potential. Contemplative drive. |

**Tier 3↔4 feedback loop:** The dependency between Social and Competence is bidirectional, not hierarchical. Competence enables social access (you need something worth exchanging — nobody accepts blobs from a shallow library). Social access enables competence (memes come from other amorphs; dependency graphs mean you need prerequisites from others; observation-based learning requires tower proximity). The ordering reflects *experiential priority*: social deprivation is more fundamental because without it, competence **erodes** autonomously (transcription errors accumulate uncorrected, library drifts). A competent hermit's library decays; an incompetent socialite's library improves. Social access is the floor; competence is the amplifier.

This coupling creates **poverty traps** (low competence → low social value → fewer exchanges → competence stagnates or decays) and **wealth spirals** (deep library → high social value → more exchanges → deeper library). Guild formation exploits the loop directly: control one side (competence via meme-stack access) to capture the other (social standing, labour, economic output). The poverty trap is the structural engine of blue-collar guild captivity (§10.4).

### 2.2 Charge Depletion — The Experience

**The physics problem:** Semiconductor junctions either conduct or they don't. A MOSFET at 90% supply voltage works identically to one at 100%. Below threshold voltage, it stops. There is no "dim cognition" mode for a transistor. Digital systems fail at a cliff, not a slope.

The amorph's neural substrate is a distributed semiconductor junction network. Each junction cluster needs threshold voltage/current to operate. At any power level above that threshold, the individual cluster works at **full fidelity**. No dimming.

**The correct model is power-budget allocation, not analog degradation:**

- **Full charge:** power budget supports N parallel junction clusters simultaneously — maximum parallel processing (deep library search, wide sensory integration, complex reasoning, motor control — all at once).
- **Reduced charge:** power budget supports M < N clusters — the amorph **sheds load** — turns off non-essential processing to keep essential processing at full fidelity.
- **Critical:** power budget supports only core survival functions — everything else OFF.
- **Below minimum:** torpor (nothing runs).

This is **closing browser tabs to save battery**, not a dimming screen. Each tab that's still open works perfectly. You just have fewer of them.

From the outside this looks like "getting dumber." From the inside, each remaining cognitive function works at full sharpness — there's just less of it running. The amorph doesn't think *poorly* — it thinks *narrowly*.

This graceful degradation is itself a product of selection pressure. An organism that crashed from full cognition to torpor with no intermediate states would be a dead organism. The shedding priority is a deeply selected trait.

**Shedding priority (first shed → last shed):**

| Priority | Function shed | Effect |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 (first) | Broad library resonance search | Queries no longer propagate body-wide. Recall narrows to local/recent memories. Distant associations lost. |
| 2 | Multi-modal sensory integration | Stops correlating EM + chemical + acoustic + visual simultaneously. Falls back to primary sense (EM) only. World becomes one-dimensional. |
| 3 | Abstract reasoning / formal WM manipulation | Complex planning collapses. Cannot hold multiple hypotheticals. Heuristic-only decision-making. |
| 4 | Secondary motor functions | Sprint impossible (can't power rigid SiC push-off formation). Fine manipulation degrades. |
| 5 (last) | Threat detection + basic locomotion + single-sense awareness | Last functions maintained. If these drop below threshold → torpor. |

**Full charge:** All processes running. Deep library search, multi-modal integration, abstract reasoning, full motor capability, wide sensory awareness. The world is vivid because the amorph is processing all of it simultaneously.

**Moderate depletion:** Shedding tiers 1–2. Each remaining process works perfectly — but the amorph has stopped running library-wide resonance and multi-modal integration. The world gets *simpler* (fewer channels processed), not *blurrier* (each channel still sharp). "I can see fine; I just can't remember why this matters."

**Severe depletion:** Shedding tiers 1–4. Basic threat detection and crawling only. Every active junction still fires at full fidelity. The amorph is not confused — it is *reduced*. Aware of immediate surroundings, capable of directed movement, unable to reason about anything beyond the next few seconds.

**Critical:** Below minimum viable threshold for any junction cluster. Torpor. Basic SiH₄ metabolism continues (chemical pool, no electrical component). The amorph is an inert gel lump. Slow chemical recharge from atmospheric SiH₄ can restore electrical function over hours to days. Vulnerable to predation, petrification (undefended body surface), wind displacement. A torpid amorph in a rain pool is in serious danger (H₂O trace exposure on inert tissue).

**"Stillness = intelligence"** (Spine §AMORPH BIOLOGY) also follows from this model: a still amorph allocates zero power to motor control, freeing the entire budget for cognition. Not degradation, just budgeting. The smartest thing you can do is stop moving.

**Cross-reference:** Memory Architecture Hub §5.4 documents the power-dependent query behaviour of the junction network (load-shedding priority, search narrowing, torpor boundary).

### 2.3 Sleep Analog

**✓ There is no sleep.** Electronic processing accumulates no "sleep pressure." No circadian rhythm (tidally locked). No neurochemical reset needed. BUT: there is a **maintenance mode** — grid-connected, low activity, surplus power devoted to memory header repair (Memory Architecture Hub §7), SiC network junction optimisation, and chemical housekeeping. Voluntary, beneficial. Resembles sleep only in that the amorph is quiet and unresponsive. Amorphs who skip maintenance accumulate index drift (memories becoming harder to find) and suboptimal junction states. Not dangerous short-term; corrosive over years.

### 2.4 The Cycle — What Replaces the Day

No day/night. The "day" is a **charge cycle.** But charge cycles alone don't produce community rhythm — they're individual, variable-length, and asynchronous. What creates shared time structure is **coordinated still-time** (maintenance mode, §2.3) and the signals that synchronise it.

#### 2.4.1 Individual Charge Cycle

**Period 1–2:** Charge at tower → forage/hunt (discharge) → return to charge. Cycle length variable: depends on charge capacity and foraging distance. Short-range foragers cycle hourly. Cross-gap sprinters: one trip, long recharge. No social coordination — each individual on their own rhythm.

**Period 3+:** Individual charge cycle persists as the metabolic heartbeat, but increasingly embedded within community time structure (below).

#### 2.4.2 Tower Signals as Community Clock

The network already modulates amorph behaviour via subtle EM signals that feel like the amorph's own impulses (Spine §ECOLOGY KEY FACTS). Pre-awakening, amorphs don't know the signals are external. Post-awakening, they know — but the signals are still there and still useful.

Among these signals are **activity-phase modulations** — periodic shifts in the tower's EM output that nudge resident amorphs toward reduced activity. These are legacy network management: the tower benefits from periodic intervals when its symbiote-coupled organisms are quiescent (reduced metabolic load on grid, surface maintenance windows, Guard patrol resets). The signal is not compulsory — amorphs can and do ignore it. But it's *convenient*: when the tower nudges "still time," the community's shared infrastructure (charging spots, market areas, root junctions) clears, the EM environment quiets, and maintenance mode becomes maximally effective (less cognitive noise from neighbours).

The result is a **community rhythm anchored to tower signal phase.** Not a day — a cycle. Possibly multiple cycles of different length depending on what the tower is optimising (short-cycle symbiote maintenance vs longer-cycle deep grid rebalancing). The community labels these the way humans label morning/evening — not by sunlight, but by tower phase.

**Still time is NOT concurrent for the whole community.** An entire population entering maintenance mode simultaneously is a predation invitation and an emergency-response gap. The tower signal itself may phase-shift across the community (nudge one sector quiet, then the next), or the community self-organises staggered rotations:

| Role | Still-time pattern |
|------|--------------------|
| Bulk population | Follows tower signal. Enters still time in staggered waves. |
| Watch/guard | Exempt from current still-time wave. Rotating duty. Minimum viable awake population for threat detection, emergency response, predator deterrence. |
| Market/service | Phase-shifted: active during transitions (catch amorphs entering and leaving still time — peak foot traffic). |
| High-status / deep-interior | Self-scheduled. Tower interior provides enough EM shielding that community phase matters less. |

**Period 2:** Proto-rhythm. Individual amorphs converge on tower signal independently. No formal coordination, but de facto synchronisation emerges because the signal affects everyone similarly. Watch function is incidental — whoever happens to be off-cycle.

**Period 3:** Formalised. Named phases. Designated watch rotation. Market times align with phase transitions. Guild schedules built around community rhythm. Still-time quality becomes a status marker (deep interior, long uninterrupted maintenance = wealthy; short, noisy, peripheral still time = poor).

**Period 4+:** Industrial overlay. Factory operations run continuously regardless of community phase. Shift work imposes its own rhythm on factory workers, potentially desynchronised from the tower signal. Two rhythms coexist: community phase (residential, social, commercial) and factory phase (production, economic). Tension between them is a labour issue.

**Still-time is contextual.** The peacetime model above assumes no hostile actors. In contested or hostile environments, the calculus changes. (See §8.3 for the three-layer EM signaling model, detection range limitations, and encryption framework.)

**Deliberate coordination signals are securable.** The still-time coordination signal is a deliberate EM communication. With salted encryption + constant-rate broadcast, both content and metadata are protected — an adversary gains nothing from intercepting the signal (§8.3.3).

**Involuntary emission observation is range-limited.** The detection range for involuntary emissions is short — conversational to social distance, not landscape-scale (§8.3.2). An adversary outside this range cannot observe a community's still-time state via EM. This makes the still-time vulnerability more localised than a landscape-surveillance model would imply: only an adversary already at close range (scouts, infiltrators, adjacent tower communities) can exploit the still-time window through EM observation.

**The residual threats are therefore:**
- **Physical reconnaissance:** Scouts at close range observing the community directly (EM sensing + physical observation). Defence: watch rotation, perimeter Guard patrols.
- **Infiltration:** An adversary within the community sensing still-time onset at close range. Defence: IFF systems, community trust networks.
- **Pattern learning:** A long-term adjacent adversary (hostile tower community) correlating deliberate-comm timing with physical observation over repeated cycles. Defence: encrypted + salted + constant-rate broadcast denies the deliberate-comm correlation; staggering and randomising still-time phase breaks physical-observation patterns.

**Wartime adaptations remain relevant but are less extreme:**
- **Stagger and randomise phase.** No synchronised mass vulnerability. Smaller groups, varying schedules.
- **Increased watch fraction.** One-third or more active at all times. Credible deterrent even if scouts observe reduced activity.
- **Perimeter security.** Guard patrols and EM-watch (amorphs on perimeter actively sensing for nearby involuntary emissions of approaching organisms). The short detection range means perimeter watch works both ways — you detect infiltrators at the same range they detect you.

**Frontier and day-side:** Small outposts in hostile territory (§2.4.4) face the same threats concentrated: small population = easier to surveil physically. Encrypted + salted + constant-rate for any EM coordination. Acoustic backup. Minimum one-third watch at all times. Still-time staggered, never community-wide.

**Escalation cost:** In sustained conflict, the primary cost is behavioural, not cryptographic. Staggered still-time reduces maintenance quality. Increased watch fraction means less total maintenance per cycle. Prolonged war accumulates maintenance debt across the entire population — chronic still-time deprivation eroding index integrity and junction optimisation (§2.3). A slow, invisible attritional cost that doesn't manifest until the war ends and amorphs discover their libraries have drifted, their junction networks are suboptimal, and their cognitive ceiling has quietly dropped. The winner of a long war is damaged in ways that aren't obvious until peacetime.

#### 2.4.3 Monastery Timekeeping

Monks at gas-pocket towers have tower signals available (gas-pocket towers are alive), but monks are the most network-aware amorphs on the planet. They *understand* the signals are external manipulation. Two approaches:

**Use the tower signal deliberately.** The monk knows the signal is not their own impulse. They follow it *as a discipline* — choosing to align with the tower's rhythm as a deliberate practice, the way a human monk follows a bell schedule they could in principle ignore. The tower signal becomes a liturgical clock. This is the pragmatic approach: the signal is free, reliable, and requires no infrastructure.

**Generate independent signals.** The monastery produces its own coordination signals — acoustic (struck SiC resonators, tuned lattice elements — the bells of a human monastery), EM (deliberate broadcast from a designated timekeeper), or both. This approach asserts independence from the network: *we set our own rhythm.* More labour-intensive. Philosophically significant for Autonomy-tradition monasteries. The abbot's hardline connection to the tower means the abbot can sense the tower signal even when the community is running on independent bells — useful for maintaining awareness of the network's state without being governed by it.

**Federation still-time:** Federated monks (abbey-scale cognition) face a unique constraint. Federation requires multiple working-memory clusters in active coordination. Still time for the federation means *all participating nodes* must enter maintenance simultaneously, or the federation must gracefully shed nodes (analogous to individual load-shedding, §2.2, but at the inter-organism scale). Abbot still-time may require the entire inner circle to go quiet — a scheduled community event, not an individual choice.

#### 2.4.4 Day-Side Timekeeping

No towers. No legacy signals. Small populations (10–50 specialists) must generate their own community rhythm from scratch.

**Options:** Manufactured EM beacons on timed cycles (requires Period 4 electronics). Acoustic signals (struck SiC — simple, reliable, low-tech). Agreed schedules maintained by a designated timekeeper. Solar position is technically available (the star is visible and fixed, but at the substellar point it's always directly overhead — no directional cue; at intermediate longitudes the star's altitude provides a static orientation reference, not a time reference). Geothermal or weather-driven cycles may provide a natural anchor if present.

**Day-side still-time is militarised.** Small outposts in hostile territory (volcanism, petrification, fluorine ecology, no EM shelter) cannot afford the luxury of informal staggering. Watch rotation is formal, mandatory, and probably the first governance structure established at any new outpost. Minimum watch: one-third of population active at all times — fewer and a single equipment failure during still time could cascade.

#### 2.4.5 Dark-Side Timekeeping

Low wind, no lightning, no thunder, no weather-driven cycles. The deep dark side has no natural rhythm at all. Coastal communities near ammonia seas may have tide-driven cycles (if tidal forcing exists — □ OPEN). Interior dark-side populations have nothing.

**Dark-side hermits** (Period 2–3 explorers, contemplatives) drift into purely self-regulated rhythms. Still time when tired, active when charged. The absence of external temporal structure is part of what makes the dark side philosophically attractive — and practically dangerous (no one notices if you slip into torpor).

### 2.5 Hierarchy Shift Across Periods

**Period 1:** Tier 1 dominates. Grid access is existential. No social tier — biofilm has no society.

**Period 2:** Tier 2 becomes important. Off-grid excursions introduce predation risk. Social tier emerges — meme exchange improves survival.

**Period 3:** Tier 4 matters. Guild membership gates access to meme stacks that dramatically improve earning capacity. Metal scarcity eases with Miner guild efficiency and industrial supply chains. Reproduction becomes a planned economic decision (budding costs ~50% catalytic metals).

**Period 4:** Industrial surplus pushes base tiers toward reliable satisfaction for guild members. Tier 5 becomes achievable. BUT: shell economy collapse devastates Tier 4 for traditional wealth-holders while opening it for the industrially-connected.

**Period 5:** Crisis pushes everything back toward Tier 1. Peripheral tower failures displace populations. SiH₄ thinning means chemical recharge takes longer. Civilisational regression for some; accelerated innovation for those trying to prevent collapse.

## 3. LOCOMOTION

### 3.1 Mode Emergence Timeline

| Mode | First appears | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Peristaltic crawling | Always (ancestral) | 0.1–0.3 m/s. Primary all periods. |
| Root railway | Stage 4 (Emergence Hub) | Grid-powered transit along conductive root. |
| Wind-surfing | Early Stage 5 / Period 2 | Deploy membrane, ride wind day-ward. One-way. |
| Sprint | Late Stage 4 / Stage 5 | 2–3 m/s, 2–3 min. Power-limited outdoors, heat-limited indoors. Survival response, not commuting. |
| Tower-hopping | Early Period 2 | Glide from tower summit to next downwind tower. One-way day-ward. Terminator only (~6.5 km spacing). |
| Ballooning | Mid Stage 5 / Period 2 | H₂ production control + membrane deployment. Return via upper-level return flow. |
| Constructed aids | Period 3+ | Sledges, improved root grips, sail frames. |
| Powered vehicles | Period 4+ | Electric propulsion. Powered flight. Watercraft. |

### 3.2 By Period × Geography

**Period 1 (Terminator):** Crawling on tower surface and root. No off-grid travel. Movement is within-tower repositioning.

**Period 2 (Terminator + sparse dark side):** Crawling between towers on grass field (stored charge + piezo trickle from grass contact — subsistence, extends range). Wind-surfing day-ward (free, one-way). Tower-hopping day-ward (climb to summit, glide to next tower — faster than wind-surfing for tower-to-tower transit at terminator spacing). Ballooning back (upper-level return flow). Root railway for safe inter-tower transit. Sprint for emergency. Dark-side explorers: slow overland crawl on polished SiC bedrock (no grass, no piezo trickle — pure stored charge) with battery organism companions for charge reserves. Low wind means no wind-surfing or tower-hopping; silence makes the journey safe but slow.

**Period 3 (Terminator + dark side):** Constructed aids. Membrane frames for efficient wind-surfing (better lift-to-drag). Root-gripping tools. Sledges for dark-side bedrock (polished SiC surface, low friction). Coastal watercraft for ammonia seas (sail-powered, manufactured composite hulls).

**Period 4 (All zones):** Powered electric vehicles. Aircraft (efficient sailplanes, ~1.5× harder than Earth flight). Ammonia-sea cargo ships at scale (big hulls favored — difficulty 2.76× Earth). Day-side vehicles carry their own power (battery organisms + solar PV). Factory internal transport (conveyor systems).

**Period 5:** Mass driver. Intercontinental balloon transit networks. Powered flight as routine transport.

### 3.3 The Wheel Question

**✓ Wheel as machine element: early, inevitable.** Pulley → gear → turbine → lathe. Fundamental from Period 3.

**✓ Wheel as vehicle: late, optional.** Root railway already handles smooth-surface transit. Terminator surface (grass-stabilized sediment wedge) is uneven — no road surface. Dark-side peneplain bedrock is flat but not axle-smooth (biofilm crust, root ridges, rain erosion channels). Wind-surfing is free and faster for downwind point-to-point. Wheels need metallic axles and bearings (Period 4 at earliest). Dark-side polished SiC bedrock is the best wheel surface but sparse population means low priority.

**Where wheels-as-vehicles appear:** Inside factory complexes (smooth manufactured floors). Deposition-zone cities (deep, packable sediment). Short-haul material handling. Never long-haul overland.

### 3.4 Tower-Hopping

> **Full derivation:** Tower Morphology Hub §11.4.

Amorphs have no fixed body plan. At 8 bar air density (~8 kg/m³), a 100 kg amorph spread to 16 m² has terminal velocity ~4.3 m/s — a gentle landing. **Falling is not dangerous.** Gel body, no organs, selectively redistributed SiC crumple zones. Same physics as balloon fauna fall-survival origin.

**Two descent modes from tower summit:**

1. **Vertical drop (recreational/leeward).** Jump from leeward face into the tower's wind shadow. Spread wide, land gently at tower base. Safe, controlled, zero displacement.

2. **Transit glide (tower-hopping).** Jump from summit into open wind. Spread into crude airfoil (gel membrane, SiC-ribbed). Glide ratio L/D ≈ 4–8 (practical best ~6). Minimum glide speed ~7.5 m/s. Glide downwind ~6.5 km to next tower's windward face. Tower upwash (~3–5 m/s, from ~80–85% bulk flow opacity) on approach extends glide and assists the climb back up (reduces effective weight 35–70% on windward face). Each hop: ~10 min glide + hours of climb (upwash-assisted). **One-way day-ward only. Terminator only** — dark-side spacing (8–20 km) exceeds glide range.

   **Mound topology effect:** The terminator is an accretional sediment wedge, not flat. Most tower-to-tower hops across the flat mound top (~0.1% grade over 6.5 km) are effectively flat-terrain geometry. But near the day-side mound crest, the day-side face drops away — towers here launch over falling terrain, extending effective glide range (ground recedes from the flight path). The last few hops off the mound crest toward the deposition zone are the easiest. Conversely, the gentle dark-side slope works against the hop geometry (marginal to begin with at dark-side spacings). The mound topology reinforces tower-hopping as a **crest-to-day-side mode** — easiest exactly where you'd use it most.

**Comparison with wind-surfing:** Wind-surfing is passive membrane deployment at ground level — simpler, no climb required, but slower (deceleration + lattice entry turbulence). Tower-hopping requires climbing to summit height (~3 hours at 1.82g) but the glide itself is faster and more controlled. For repeated tower-to-tower transit at terminator spacing, hopping is the premium mode: skilled, efficient, socially visible. Wind-surfing remains the accessible default.

**Recreational climbing:** Tower climbing is a zero-mortality-risk activity. Summit is a novel sensory environment (exposed EM, acoustic transition, raw wind, full-sky view above the lattice). Universal meme potential — easy to learn, hard to master. The windward face is preferred for upwash weight reduction. Authorization depends on chelation badge: recognized mutualists tolerated or assisted; unrecognized climbers contested by Healer immune response.

### 3.5 Watercraft

Amorphs sink in ammonia (1050 vs 660 kg/m³). Swimming is not an option — you sink and broadcast your thoughts involuntarily (dielectric coupling in liquid NH₃).

**Hull:** Hollow composite (SiC fiber in PCS matrix). Net lift ~600 kg/m³ for thin-walled hull. Big ships favored: hull mass scales as surface area, cargo as volume.

**Propulsion:** Sail. Permanent unidirectional wind at terminator. Downwind trivial. Upwind requires tacking — possible but slow. Period 4: electric propulsion.

**Emergence:** Late Period 2 or early Period 3. First vessels: hollowed SiC boulders (dead-bug megafauna shells). Period 3: manufactured composite hulls. True ocean-going vessels Period 4.

---

## 4. TRANSPORT NETWORKS

### 4.1 Routes by Period

**Period 1–2:** No formal routes. Paths are individual knowledge — memes encoding tower locations, root paths, wind patterns. Navigation memes are valuable IP.

**Period 3:** Established trade routes. Chemical/physical trail markers at root junctions (deposited SiC grit patterns indicating direction/destination). Wind corridors named and mapped. Root-junction towns as waypoints.

**Period 4:** Constructed infrastructure. Root surfaces improved (smoothed, widened at junctions). Relay charging stations (battery organisms stationed by entrepreneurs). Signal towers (manufactured SiC pylons with EM beacons) marking off-root routes. Day-side supply corridors with staged battery depots.

**Period 5:** Intercontinental transit. Standardised balloon routes. Powered flight corridors. Mass driver launch infrastructure.

### 4.2 Root Railway Operations

**Infrastructure:** The root itself. Conductive SiC surface provides grid power to any amorph in contact. Speed: limited by crawling (0.1–0.3 m/s, ~8–26 km/day). Energy: unlimited while in contact.

**Access:** Physically ungateable — Schottky coupling is physics, not permission. Anyone touching the root draws power. BUT: Guard organisms patrol roots near tower bases. Foreign-network amorphs attacked (IFF mismatch). Same-network amorphs tolerated.

**Congestion:** At root junctions near tower bases — physical crowding where multiple roots converge. High-demand charging spots (highest grid potential) are contested. □ OPEN: formal queue/priority systems?

### 4.3 Bulk Cargo

Gel actuators at ~5 kPa are very weak. A 100 kg amorph exerts ~500 N maximum force. Moving 500 kg overland is a multi-organism job.

| Period | Method | Capacity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 2 | Multiple amorphs dragging. Found-object levers/rollers. | ~body-mass per amorph |
| 3 | Sledges on root surfaces. Fiber rope + pulley. Ammonia-canal barges. Domesticated haulers. | 5–10× body-mass per team |
| 4 | Mechanical vehicles. Ammonia hydraulic loaders. Electric winches (tower-powered). Cargo ships. | Industrial scale |
| 5 | Mass driver for space-bound cargo. Balloon freight. | Tonnes |

**Wind as cargo aid:** Cargo sledge with sail on the terminator surface (grass-stabilized sediment wedge at terminator; polished SiC bedrock on dark side). 9.5 m/s wind drives a low-friction sledge day-ward for free. Return cargo requires root railway, balloon, or upwind tacking by watercraft.

---

## 5. CARRYING AND LOGISTICS

### 5.1 What Is a Tool?

For a gel organism, a tool is **an internal object extruded through a pseudopod** when needed. No handle, no grip — the gel IS the grip. A SiC blade carried inside the body, embedded in gel. To use: form pseudopod around blade, extend, cut, retract.

Consequences: tools have no ergonomics (pure working surfaces). Theft requires physical invasion of the body. Tool inventory limited by body volume. Large tools require external carry.

### 5.2 Manufactured Goods by Period

| Period | Goods | Materials |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| 2 | Found-object tools (resharpened dead-bug SiC plates, shell containers). Crude fiber rope (PCS strands). | Scavenged SiC, self-extruded PCS |
| 3 | Purpose-made SiC blades. Woven fiber baskets/bags. Composite containers. Battery organism harnesses. Agricultural tools. | Manufactured SiC composite, cultivated materials |
| 4 | Metallurgical products (electrodes, wires, EDM-machined components). Fiber composite structures. Optical instruments (CVD SiC mirrors). SiC LEDs. Engineered memes. Ammonia pressure vessels. | Metals, precision composites, optics |
| 5 | Space hardware. Mass driver components. Probe payload. | Full tech stack |

### 5.3 Packaging

**Period 2:** Internal carry (small/valuable) or gel-extruded PCS film (temporary, degrades). No standardised containers.

**Period 3:** SiC composite boxes with friction-fit lids. Standardised SiC plate dimensions (5mm = currency unit). Fiber sacks for bulk granular.

**Period 4:** Sealed ammonia-rated pressure vessels (day-side NH₃ transport). Modular cargo frames. Factory logistics pallets.

---

## 6. SHELTER AND ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1 What Is a Room?

A room is an **EM-shielded enclosure.** Visual privacy is nearly irrelevant (vision is secondary sense). The thing you want from a wall is: stop others from sensing your thoughts and stop their thoughts from intruding on yours.

A "door" is a gap in the Faraday cage. Walking into a shielded space feels like stepping out of a noisy crowd into a silent library. Nearby cognitive chatter vanishes. Your own thoughts become crisper.

### 6.2 By Period × Geography

**Period 1 (Terminator):** No architecture. Tower IS the shelter. Lattice interior provides EM shielding, wind protection, acoustic dampening, grid power.

**Period 2 (Terminator):** Lee-face accumulations. Downwind debris forms wind-sheltered mounds. Amorphs camp in lee-face hollows — preferentially near the day-side mound crest, where the dropping terrain extends the lee zone (§12.4). Crude modification: push debris into windbreak walls. First "architecture" is wind-sheltering, not EM-shielding.

**Period 3 (Terminator):** Grown structures. Amorphs extrude SiC composite walls from their own bodies — secrete PCS, spin fiber, ceramify in place. Low conductive domes with sealable EM gaps (doors). Root-junction towns: clusters of grown structures around root intersections. Tower-interior carved spaces for high-status individuals — rooms within the tower's Faraday cage. Requires network tolerance (Healers fill back in modifications that degrade signal propagation).

**Period 3 (Dark side — monasteries):** Gas-pocket tower interior, acoustically tuned. Monk-carved spaces optimised for contemplation (maximum EM shielding, minimum acoustic intrusion). Abbot chambers: deep interior, multiple hardline lattice connections, spread-flat sessile configuration for heat dissipation. Communal spaces: mid-depth lattice with deliberately enlarged pores for amorph-scale occupancy.

**Period 4 (Terminator):** Fiber composite architecture. Manufactured building panels, welded assemblies (no fasteners — welding is native, Mohs 9.5 threading is not; see Industrialization Hub §1.1). First multi-story structures independent of towers, powered by independent lightning tower grid. Healer-directed construction (amorphs learn tower signal protocols, replay to redirect Healer deposition — meme, not genome; see Industrialization Hub §3). Factory complexes: large open-floor structures with ammonia shower cooling systems (wet/dry zone separation), heavy electrical feeds from lightning grid.

**Period 4 (Deposition zone):** Post-industrial residential. Ancient stopped towers in deep sediment. Low wind. Dead towers = no network surveillance, no behavioural nudging. First place amorphs live free of Blindsight oversight. Cultural centre, residential district, launch corridor.

**Period 4 (Day side):** Outpost architecture. Sealed composite domes. Solar PV arrays. Geothermal boreholes. Ammonia pressure vessels. Battery organism charging stations. Small populations (10–50) of specialists. Functional, sealed, hostile. No aesthetic ambition.

### 6.3 Acoustic Design

Terminator is acoustically brutal: continuous 8-bar thunder (shockwave, not just sound), Aeolian lattice hum (~1 kHz), wind noise, lightning discharge.

**Methods:**
- **Helmholtz absorbers** built into walls, tuned to thunder frequencies. Standard in Period 3+.
- **Impedance mismatch:** Multi-layer walls (alternating dense SiC and light PCS foam). Reflect shockwaves at density boundaries.
- **Lattice depth:** Deeper tower interior = more attenuation. High-status spaces are deep.
- **Dark-side advantage:** Low wind (2–8 m/s), no lightning, no thunder. Monasteries are quiet by geography, not engineering.

## 7. FEEDING, METABOLISM, AND THERMOREGULATION

### 7.1 "Eating" — SiH₄ Processing

No mouth. No food in the human sense. "Eating" is **breathing.** Atmospheric SiH₄ at 0.3% enters through body surface, reacts with metallosilazane enzymes internally, releases energy. Passive and continuous. An amorph doesn't decide to eat. Increasing surface area (spread thin, face into wind) increases intake rate. Provides ~300W baseline at 100 kg.

**Metal intake is the dietary analog.** Catalytic metals (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co) consumed by metabolism must be replenished. Sources: dead-bug debris, tower Miner exchange, mineral-rich rain puddle residue, root biofilm scrapings. Metal hunger is the closest thing to food-seeking behaviour: specific cravings for depleted metals, foraging oriented toward known metal sources, satisfaction on replenishment.

### 7.2 "Drinking" — Ammonia Intake

Ammonia = solvent + coolant + chemical co-substrate. Not food — more like water.

**Terminator:** Abundant. Rain is intermittent but reliable. Absorb through body surface. Rain NH₃ is H₂O-poor (distillation shield). Refreshing — cooling + chemical renewal.

**Dark side:** Cold (215–240K). Ammonia seas stable. Coastal populations have easy access. Interior: no rain, no liquid. Must carry reserves.

**Day side (Period 4+):** Two zones. (1) Near-terminator day side (within 20–30°): direct access to ammonia runoff — 80–95% of terminator rainfall lands on the day-side slope of the sediment mound, flows day-ward as ephemeral rivers/deltas until evaporating at the ~240K boundary. Daysiders near the mound face do NOT need to import ammonia. (2) Deep day side (beyond evaporation boundary): no liquid NH₃ without pressure vessels (saturation pressure at 300K ≈ 10.6 bar > ~1 bar partial pressure). Must import from terminator. Ammonia is the most precious deep-day-side commodity.

### 7.3 Charging at a Tower

Approach tower root or lattice surface. Extend pseudopod. Schottky contact forms. Current flows in.

**Sensation:** Cognitive acceleration. Like waking from drowsiness. Thoughts sharpen, library becomes accessible (resonance queries powered up), working memory expands (more junctions activated), EM sensing sharpens. You get smarter as you charge.

**Duration:** 30–60 minutes to functional charge from moderate depletion (100 kg at healthy tower root). Full charge: hours.

**Social dimension:** Charging spots are gathering places. Root junctions where paths converge = agora, town square, watering hole. Grid-connected, smart, and surrounded by other smart organisms. This is when meme exchange happens, news passes, deals are struck, art is shared. The recharge phase IS social life.

### 7.4 Thermoregulation

| Condition | ΔT above ambient | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Rest (300W) in open | +2–4K | h≈75 W/m²·K handles it easily |
| Rest in shelter | +4–10K | h≈25–35 (natural convection). Comfortable. |
| Active (750W) in open | +5–8K | Manageable |
| Active in shelter | +10–25K | Warm. Need breaks or ventilation. |
| Peak (5000W) in open | +31K (271K total) | Safe. Post-sprint: spread thin, cool. |
| Peak in shelter | +78K (318K total) | DANGEROUS. Gel denatures ~330K. Never sprint indoors. |

**Ammonia evaporative cooling:** 1370 J/g latent heat. 1–3 g/s at peak. Effective at terminator (liquid NH₃ available). Useless on day side.

**Factory thermal management (Period 4+):** Ammonia shower systems — liquid NH₃ sprayed on hot surfaces and workers, evaporated, condensed elsewhere. Wet/dry zone separation. Workers in wet zone are ammonia-drenched (cool). Dry zone: precision work, meme blob production and absorption (ammonia interferes with transcription chemistry).

## 8. SOCIAL LIFE

### 8.1 Social Units by Period

| Period | Dominant social unit |
|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Biofilm (community = the film). No individuality. |
| 2 | Small bands (3–8) around shared tower. Fission-fusion. Solitary specialists exist. |
| 3 | Tower communities (50–500). Guild structures. Root-junction towns. Monasteries. |
| 4 | Urban populations (thousands per tower complex). Corporations. Residential suburbs. |
| 5 | Planetary-scale polities. Forced collaboration. |

### 8.2 Meme Exchange — The Mechanism

Meme transfer works like budding, not like a handshake. The donor **transcribes** the desired meme(s) into a detached gel blob — a physical object containing polysilane-encoded data, keys, and headers. The blob is inert (no junction network, no cognition) but chemically stable. The recipient can then **choose** to absorb it, integrating the meme content into their own library.

Direct contact is not required. The donor extrudes the blob from a pseudopod and sets it down; the recipient picks it up later, examines it (resonance query on the blob's headers without absorbing), and decides whether to incorporate. This is the default commercial transaction: vendor produces blob, buyer inspects, buyer absorbs.

Direct contact CAN happen — donor extends pseudopod, blob transfers at the interface, recipient absorbs immediately. This looks like a contact exchange and is faster, but it's the same underlying operation (transcribe → detach → absorb), just compressed in space and time.

**Consequences of the blob model:**

- **Asynchronous exchange:** Donor need not be present when recipient absorbs. Dead drops, mail, stored packages.
- **Physical meme libraries:** Collections of blobs, stored on powered grid (captive meme on conductive surface = indefinite preservation). Tower walls as library shelves.
- **Inspection before absorption:** Recipient can query blob headers via resonance without absorbing content. You know what a meme claims to be before you take it. Fraud = header/content mismatch (detectable by Monks).
- **Theft is physical:** Stealing a meme blob is stealing an object. Guild IP security is partly physical custody.
- **Batch production:** A skilled copyist transcribes the same meme repeatedly, producing multiple blobs. Mass production (Period 4).

**Social intimacy spectrum:** The spectrum is about what you PUT in the blob, not about contact surface area. A casual greeting blob: identity signature (IFF-descended key), emotional state, a scrap of news. Takes seconds to produce. An intimate exchange: large meme package — you give someone the *memory* of an experience, not a description of it. Takes minutes. Budding is the extreme: full library review, selective transcription of a life's accumulation. Merge is not exchange at all — it is destruction and recombination.

**The social act** is still the giving, not the mechanics. Producing a blob for someone is a deliberate choice to share part of yourself. Accepting someone's blob is a deliberate choice to let their experience into your library. The intimacy gradient is real — it just isn't gated by physical proximity.

### 8.3 The EM Environment

#### 8.3.1 Three Layers of EM Signaling

Amorph EM output has three functionally distinct layers:

**Layer 1 — Involuntary emission:** Physical byproduct of semiconductor junction processing. Every active junction radiates. This is body heat, not speech — a physical consequence of the machinery running. Cannot be encrypted (the term has no meaning in this context). Reveals: activity level, emotional state (processing pattern signature), approximate neural mass, general health. The amorph equivalent of autonomic tells — pupil dilation, heart rate, perspiration, skin flush. Honest signals. The organism cannot ordinarily control them because they ARE the processing, not a signal about the processing.

**Layer 2 — Deliberate emotional conventions:** Established signaling patterns — learned, culturally transmitted (memes) — that communicate specific emotional context. The amorph equivalents of the human smile, the raised eyebrow, the reassuring nod. Produced by deliberately modulating junction activity to generate recognisable EM patterns. Conscious. Performative. Universal conventions exist (some very ancient, predating language), plus regional/cultural variants.

The critical property: **Layer 2 can contradict Layer 1.** An amorph projecting the conventional signal for calm confidence while their involuntary emissions betray anxiety is doing exactly what a human does when forcing a smile through distress. At conversational range, a perceptive observer can detect both layers simultaneously — the manufactured emotional signal AND the honest involuntary emission beneath it. Reading this contradiction is a social skill. Exploiting it is manipulation. Hiding it is monk training.

**Layer 3 — Deliberate communication** (100 MHz–2 GHz): intentional modulated EM. Radio. Structured signal with semantic content. Produced by the same semiconductor hardware but with controlled modulation — the difference between a lightbulb's heat radiation and a signal lamp. Range ∝ power. Directional beaming possible. Encryptable (§8.3.3).

| Layer | Human analog | Control | Encryptable | Trust level |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 — Involuntary | Autonomic tells (blushing, sweating, pupil dilation) | None (ordinary), partial (trained), considerable (monk) | No | High — honest signal |
| 2 — Conventional | Facial expressions, gestures (smile, nod, frown) | Full (conscious performance) | No (public convention) | Medium — can be faked |
| 3 — Communication | Speech, writing | Full | Yes | Context-dependent |

**The Layer 1/2 contradiction is a rich social signal.** When someone's conventional emotional display matches their involuntary emission, they are perceived as genuine. When the two diverge, the observer faces the same interpretive challenge as reading a human whose words say "I'm fine" while their hands shake. Social intelligence in amorphs partly consists of reading this gap. Skilled liars minimise it. Skilled readers detect it.

**Monk signal control:** Monks have considerable learned control over Layer 1, varying by skill level. Where ordinary amorphs broadcast emotional state as automatically as a human blushes, a skilled monk can suppress, modulate, or shape their involuntary emission profile. This is the EM equivalent of a master poker player who controls micro-expressions — or an actor who produces genuine-seeming autonomic responses on demand. It makes monks dangerous: they can align Layer 1 to match any Layer 2 performance, eliminating the contradiction that ordinary amorphs rely on to detect deception. The involuntary channel that every other amorph trusts implicitly (because it IS involuntary) becomes unreliable in the presence of a monk. One more reason guilds fear monasteries.

#### 8.3.2 Detection Range — What Is and Isn't Established

**Established:**
- Amorphs perceive involuntary emissions from other intelligent amorphs.
- These emissions provide emotional context in face-to-face interaction.
- Detection is mutual at conversational range (both parties sense each other).
- Monks can modulate their own involuntary emissions to a degree.

**Not established:**
- The exact frequencies of involuntary emission.
- The fidelity of perception at different ranges.
- The effective detection range.
- Whether any biological path to directional EM detection exists.

**Physical constraints on range:** Semiconductor junction switching produces broadband emission. The 8-bar atmosphere at 12.5% NH₃ is a strong absorber across much of the EM spectrum (ammonia's rotational spectrum is dense from sub-THz through THz). Higher-frequency components attenuate over shorter distances. Lower-frequency components propagate further but carry less power from junction transients. The net effect is that involuntary emission detection range is **shorter than previously assumed** — probably conversational to social distance, not landscape-scale.

**✓ "Mutual permanent detection" killed.** Was an assumption, not a derivation from physics. The atmospheric absorption profile (12.5% NH₃, 8 bar) does not support landscape-scale EM detection by individual organisms. Spine §EM ECOLOGY revised accordingly.

**What this means for individual amorphs:** The EM sense is an **intimate** sense — it operates at social distances, providing rich emotional and cognitive context for face-to-face interaction. An individual amorph is NOT a landscape-scale surveillance platform.

**Two exceptions to short-range detection:**

1. **Subwoofer packs** (Fauna Hub §6.5): distributed phased-array EM detection achieves range beyond any individual organism. The inter-tower gap is the subwoofer's hunting ground — no Faraday shelter from phased-array detection.

2. **Tower lattice + fairy ring arrays (AWACS):** Two complementary systems. (a) **Tower body:** Faraday cage surface currents = detection signal. External EM induces currents on the conductive lattice — those currents cancel the field inside, and the network reads them as signal. The tower's entire corpus is an antenna — not optimised for detection (morphology shaped by filtration/accretion), but sheer scale compensates. Angle-dependent sensitivity: airfoil cross-section creates systematic EM blind spots along wind axis (edge-on). Maximum sensitivity broadside. (b) **Fairy ring antenna arrays:** surface roots spawn rings of varying-height SiC stalks at resistance-regular intervals. Each ring is a 3D phased-array antenna (azimuth from ring geometry, elevation from height variation). Local FPGA at root node decodes received EM frames, computes 3D bearing + signal strength, sends reports to tower via root. Fairy rings are the tower's PRIMARY spatial awareness system — the tower body provides bulk detection while fairy rings provide direction, range, and authentication of every EM source in the territory. Together: strong but **imperfect** EM coverage. Wind-axis blind spots on the tower body partially mitigated by fairy ring arrays at different bearings. Multiple towers compensate for each other. **The network has extensive situational awareness of its own territory, with gaps.** An amorph crossing between towers is not being watched by other amorphs — but the towers on either side probably see it (fairy rings along roots track anything EM-active in their vicinity, tower body catches broadside crossings), depending on approach angle.

Whether any particular amorph benefits from tower AWACS depends entirely on the network's willingness to share intelligence. For favoured symbiotes (Period 1): implicitly, via tropism management. For free-range amorphs (Period 2+): only if the network has reason to cooperate. For monks: not at all — they are off-network. For warfare: whoever controls tower access controls the sensor network. Blinding the towers isn't just cutting power — it's destroying AWACS.

□ OPEN: Involuntary emission frequencies, fidelity vs range curve, effective detection range for single organism and for aggregate community emission, tower detection range and angular resolution, whether the network actively shares EM intelligence with symbiotes or only uses it for internal management.

#### 8.3.3 Encryption of Deliberate Communications

**Can amorphs encrypt deliberate EM communication? Yes.** The prerequisites are all present: digital-capable processing substrate (semiconductor junctions with threshold behaviour), native arithmetic (Spine §AMORPH BIOLOGY), and a structured modulation channel. Asymmetric-key encryption is modular arithmetic over a signal — math they can already do, applied to a channel they already use. Encryption is a learned protocol (a meme), not a biological capability.

The biological key system (allosteric activators for memory access, Memory Architecture Hub §4) is a chemical analog of keyed access but operates on completely different principles. EM encryption is mathematical, not chemical. Different mechanism, analogous concept. An amorph conversant in both has an intuition for information security spanning two domains.

**What encryption with salting protects:** Signal content, fully. With proper salting (nonces), any two encryptions of the same plaintext are indistinguishable from each other or from random noise. An adversary cannot pattern-match across ciphertexts to determine that two signals carried the same instruction. No codebook can be built from encrypted traffic alone.

**What encryption does NOT protect:**

| Metadata | Intelligence value |
|----------|-------------------|
| Signal existence | Someone transmitted. Activity is occurring. |
| Timing | When they transmitted. |
| Source location | Where the transmitter is (if directional sensing exists). |
| Power level | How far they intended the signal to reach. |
| Duration | Long message vs short. (Paddable — fixed-length frames eliminate this.) |

**Constant-rate broadcast** (continuous transmission, real signals indistinguishable from padding) denies even the timing/existence metadata channel. With encryption + salting + constant-rate broadcast, an adversary gains nothing from intercepting deliberate communications.

**Operational security model:**

| Layer | Threat | Countermeasure |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 — Involuntary emission | Activity observation at close range; emotional state intelligence | Behavioural discipline (suppress processing, accept cognitive cost). Faraday shelter. Monk training (Layer 1 control). Range-limited by atmospheric absorption. |
| 2 — Emotional conventions | Deception detection (reading Layer 1/2 contradiction) | Monk training (align Layer 1 to match Layer 2 performance). Social skill — no technological solution. |
| 3 — Deliberate comms | Eavesdropping + metadata analysis | Salted encryption (content) + constant-rate broadcast (metadata). Both are learned memes. |

Most communities in peacetime use no countermeasures (the tower signal is public and involuntary emissions are readable by anyone nearby). Wartime, frontier, and monastery contexts drive adoption. Monks, with the deepest mathematical libraries and trained involuntary-emission control, are best positioned at every layer — another monastery service with military value.

#### 8.3.4 The Experiential Landscape

You can sense everyone nearby thinking. "Nearby" means **close** — conversational to social distance. This is an intimate sense, not radar.

**Alone between towers:** Silence. Only your own thoughts. No other cognitive signatures within range. If another amorph is 500m away, you probably don't know it. What dark-side monks seek — and what makes the inter-tower gap lonely as well as dangerous. (You feel alone. The towers on either side may not agree — their lattice has been reading your surface currents, at least from the angles where their feeding-shaped geometry happens to face you. Whether that matters depends on whether the network cares.)

**Small group (2–5):** Each cognitive signature distinct, recognisable. You sense who's thinking hard, who's relaxed, who's distressed — Layer 1 (involuntary). You also read their deliberate emotional displays — Layer 2 (conventional) — and note where the two diverge. A companion projecting reassurance while their involuntary emissions spike with fear is as readable as a human whose voice says "everything's fine" while their hands tremble. Deliberate communication (Layer 3, encrypted or not) is layered on top. You experience all three simultaneously: autonomic state, emotional performance, and semantic content.

**Tower community (50–500):** On the tower itself, organisms are packed close. Dense hum of involuntary emissions from immediate neighbours. Individual signatures of those closest merge into a community texture. Familiar signatures (friends, rivals) stand out at close range; more distant tower residents are beyond involuntary-emission range but reachable by deliberate comm. Busy café where you hear the people at your table breathing AND receive messages from across the room.

**Urban crowd (thousands):** Overwhelming in dense areas (market plazas, charging stations, factory floors). Terminator-raised amorphs develop cognitive filters (memes for EM noise reduction). Without filters: the emotional pressure of hundreds of minds at close quarters. EM equivalent of a packed rush-hour train — not a roaring stadium (you sense your neighbours intensely, not the whole city).

**EM etiquette:** "Thinking quietly" — directing processing inward, reducing Layer 1 broadcast. The polite thing in close quarters (speaking softly). "Thinking loudly" — broadcasting involuntary emission at high power. Assertive, dominant, or distressed (shouting). Unfiltered loud thinking near others is rude or threatening. Layer 2 etiquette: projecting appropriate conventional emotional signals for context (the social smile, the greeting pattern). Failure to produce expected Layer 2 signals reads as cold, hostile, or dissociated. Layer 3 etiquette: encrypted private conversations in public are normal (like texting); unencrypted broadcast in a crowd is the equivalent of shouting into a megaphone.

### 8.4 Population Density

| Zone × Period | Approximate density |
|---|---|
| Terminator, Period 2 | ~2–5/km² (metal-limited) |
| Terminator, Period 3 | ~5–15/km² |
| Terminator, Period 4 | ~20–100/km² near industrial centres |
| Dark side, Period 2–3 | <0.5/km² |
| Dark side, Period 4 | ~1–5/km² near coast/monasteries |
| Day side, Period 4 | <0.1/km² (frontier outposts) |

□ OPEN: Precise population estimates need tower density and carrying capacity modelling.

### 8.5 Merge and Budding Social Dynamics

**Budding (reproduction):** An amorph is "ready" when: (1) sufficient mass (budding 50 kg from 100 kg costs half catalytic metals), (2) sufficient library depth, (3) economic stability (post-bud recovery = metal re-accumulation). Guild members face restrictions on budding (offspring carry guild memes = IP leak risk). Farmers bud most freely (surplus enables fast recovery). Period 3+: reproduction is a planned economic decision, like a major investment.

**Merge (destructive):** N→1. All participants cease to exist. Taboo for casual use. Reserved for: (1) crisis population reduction (the group decides who merges), (2) genius creation for out-of-context problems, (3) judicial merge (Period 2 dispute resolution). Anyone advocating merge must overcome the fundamental objection: someone is going to die. Multiple someones. The new entity carries their memories but IS NOT THEM. Existentially terrifying.

## 9. ECONOMY AND COMMERCE

### 9.1 What's for Sale

| Period | Goods | Services | Memes |
|--------|-------|----------|-------|
| 2 | Dead-bug SiC plates, metals, found tools | Route knowledge, combat assistance | Navigation, hunting techniques |
| 3 | Purpose-made tools, agricultural products (battery organisms, thorn-flowers), fiber goods | Guild services, Monk diagnostics | Guild skill stacks (controlled access), artistic compositions |
| 4 | Manufactured goods (composite, metal, LEDs, optics, pressure vessels), day-side imports | Industrial services, communication relay, financial brokerage | Mass-produced engineered memes, platform subscriptions |
| 5 | Space hardware, crisis equipment | Planetary logistics, network interface | Crisis-adapted packages, astronavigation |

### 9.2 What Is a Market?

A charging location near a tower root junction where amorphs gather. Period 3+:
- Central root access (charge while trading)
- EM-shielded alcoves for private transactions (meme transfer without broadcast)
- Open area for physical goods display
- Battery organism pens (charge economy)

**Meme retail:** Vendor sits at market, produces meme blobs on demand. Buyer inspects (resonance query on headers — what does it claim to contain?), pays, absorbs. No direct contact required. Fast transactions: blob production takes seconds for simple memes, minutes for complex packages. Quality assessment by reputation, header inspection, and Monk certification (when affordable).

**Quality tiers:** Source fidelity matters. First-generation copy (from original crafter) = premium. Each subsequent copy introduces transcription noise. Nth-generation memes are degraded but functional. Monks assess fidelity directly.

### 9.3 Regional Trade

| Region | Exports | Imports |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Day side** | Power (solar + geothermal), fluorine products, native metals, fissile materials | Manufactured goods, labour. Deep day-side: liquid ammonia (critical). Near-terminator daysiders: self-sufficient in ammonia (mound runoff). |
| **Terminator** | Liquid NH₃, manufactured goods, labour, memes | Power, raw metals, fluorine, fissile |
| **Dark side** | Marine products (glass organisms, concentrated H₂O, Tesla valve organisms, anti-petrification biochemistry), archaeological materials | Power, tools, memes, ammonia |

### 9.4 Wartime Economics (Period 3+)

**Ammonia embargo:** Deep-day-side populations depend on imported liquid NH₃. Cutting supply = siege. Near-terminator daysiders have mound runoff access and are less vulnerable. Daysider raids on terminator settlements target POWER (charge) and METALS (tower-delivered catalytic metals), not ammonia.

**Fluorine counter-leverage:** Day-side controls fluorine ecology. Fluorine weapons are merge-contagious, meme-destroying — weapons of cultural destruction. The taboo exists because their use threatens civilisational extinction.

**Flechette supply chain:** Metal-doped glass + fluorine. Glass from dark-side marine organisms. Fluorine from day-side volcanic ecology. Metal doping from day-side mines. No single region builds the complete weapon — enforced interdependence.

---

## 10. GOVERNANCE, LEGAL SYSTEMS, AND LABOUR

### 10.1 Governance by Period

**Period 1:** None. Network manages biofilm via energy-gradient tropism. No individuality.

**Period 2:** Band-level consensus. Disputes: (a) EM dominance display (loudest/strongest), (b) departure (dissenter leaves), (c) merge-judgment (disputants merge → combined entity makes binding decision → buds back). Merge-judgment is judicial suicide producing a Solomon.

**Period 3:** Tower-community governance. Designated dissenters (institutionalised opposition — someone's JOB is to argue against proposals). Lattice-shielded argument chambers (EM-private debate without the crowd sensing participants' emotional state). Guild arbitration for commercial disputes.

**Period 4:** Written constitutions (Monk-attested, etched in SiC). Corporate personhood. Formal courts with molecular testimony. Professional legal advocates.

**Period 5:** Crisis governance. Emergency powers. Forced collaboration (monks have trajectory math, terminator has hardware — neither can deflect alone).

### 10.2 Identity Law

The fundamental problem: amorph identity is unstable. Merge destroys participants. Budding creates memory-sharing offspring.

**Solutions (Period 4):**
- **Corporate personhood:** Durable legal identity not tied to a body. The "person" holding contracts is an abstract entity. When the organism merges, corporate identity persists (designated successor or dissolved). Necessity, not legal fiction.
- **Pre-merge declarations:** Before voluntary merge, register obligations with legal authority. Merged entity inherits all.
- **Criminal liability:** Attaches to the meme set, not the body. If criminal's memes survive in offspring (via budding), offspring carries liability. If destroyed via merge, liability dissolves (perpetrator genuinely dead). Controversial.

### 10.3 Molecular Testimony

Monks read meme structure. Examining an amorph's memory determines: what was experienced (content), when/by whom created (provenance metadata), whether tampered (checksum), whether memories are missing (orphaned headers). Forensic evidence better than DNA. BUT: Monk access is expensive. Two-tier justice: those who afford Monk testimony get reliable justice; those who can't get consensus-by-merge or guild arbitration.

### 10.4 Guild Structure and Labour

**✓ Guild = meme cartel.** Controls vocational meme stacks. Apprenticeship = incremental access. Dependency graphs deliberately engineered as IP defense.

| Tier | Character | Position | Guild control |
|------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Blue-collar** (Practitioners) | Routine execution. Interchangeable. | Zero leverage. Replaceable. Subsistence wages. | Total. Defection = fluorine dart. |
| **White-collar** (Artisans) | Topology-dependent genius. Novel insights. | Irreplaceable. Gilded cage. Premium compensation. | Negotiated. Retirement option exists. |

**Guild internal:** Practitioners, artisans, graph architects (know the topology), brokers (escrow + phage access — HR, not technicians). Escalating trust and captivity.

**Retirement:** Universal meme-destroying phage (cleaves polysilane backbone generically). Process: (1) member transcribes ALL memes into blobs held by broker (escrow), (2) phage wipes all memes in member, (3) broker feeds non-guild meme blobs back for re-absorption. Member conscious through the wipe. Same tool for punishment: wipe without restore = identity erasure.

**Labour resistance:** Difficult. Blue-collar perfectly interchangeable — strikes gain nothing. Resistance forms: (a) defection to monasteries, (b) meme piracy (dependency graphs make fragments useless without prerequisites), (c) political pressure for statutory regulation (requires written law → Monk involvement).

### 10.5 Monk Roles

| Function | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Quality certification | Read meme structure, verify fidelity, certify provenance. FDA analog. |
| Forensic testimony | Examine memories in legal proceedings. Expert witness. |
| Therapy | De-weight trauma by reading and adjusting memory structures. |
| Corporate counterweight | Verify guild meme stacks, expose IP abuse. |
| Network interface | Translate network signals, read symbiote libraries. |
| Key bank | Preserve rare keys for community access. |

**Monks do NOT advertise full capabilities.** Guild attack on monastery = suicide (monastery federation is the most powerful cognitive entity on the planet). Missing hunters don't come back. Restraint mistaken for weakness.

---

## 11. AESTHETICS AND ART

### 11.1 What Is Beauty?

For an organism whose primary sense is EM: **beauty is elegant cognition.** An amorph whose thinking is efficient, harmonious, and complex has a beautiful EM signature. You admire how someone thinks, not how they look. Partially objective (some processing patterns are mathematically harmonious) and partially subjective (resonance depends on observer's own SiC topology).

### 11.2 Art Forms by Sense

**EM art (primary):** Deliberate modulation of cognitive emission. "EM compositions" — thinking specific patterns for nearby observers. Performance art: the artist thinks beautifully. Requires proximity (EM attenuates). Cannot be recorded (ephemeral). The most valued and least reproducible art form.

**Chemical art:** Perfumery at ppb complexity. Layered, evolving scent sequences triggering memory resonances. Combined with EM art for multi-sensory compositions.

**Acoustic art:** Wind-song: free-standing SiC structures tuned to produce specific sounds in the wind. NOT tower modification (network would penalise). Ultrasonic compositions (to 50 kHz — rich harmonic space). Thunder-frequency percussion: felt in the body, not just heard.

**Visual art (secondary sense):** Near-IR palette (star peak 850nm). Pattern regularity (SiC crystal growth, lattice geometry). Lightning displays. Volcanic landscapes (day-siders). Late development — most amorphs don't prioritise vision. Monks develop visual appreciation first (parabolic eyes + contemplative practice).

### 11.3 Curated Merge as Performance Art

The audience LIVES the artwork. A curated merge is a composed experiential sequence — a meme package designed to produce a specific subjective journey when loaded. The artist crafts memory sequences, structures index relationships, plants emotional triggers.

**Performance:** Artist produces composition blobs. Audience members absorb individually. Experience unfolds internally — each through their own SiC topology, same composition, subtly different experience (non-idempotent). Can be experienced live (artist produces blobs at performance) or asynchronously (stored blobs — the album, the recording). Closest human analog: VR + drug trip where the content is someone else's curated memories and emotions.

**Composition:** Requires deep memory architecture knowledge (how headers, keys, content interact). Master artists approach Monk-level understanding. Possibly a route from art to contemplation.

**Criticism:** Can't critique without absorbing. Critical discourse is meme-exchange: share your experience-of-the-experience.

### 11.4 Art by Period

| Period | Art forms |
|--------|-----------|
| 1 | None |
| 2 | Proto-art: wind-song (accidental — sheltering structures produce tones). Chemical self-decoration. |
| 3 | All forms active. Curated merge develops. Guild-produced meme art. Wind-song sculpture. Perfumery. |
| 4 | Industrial meme entertainment. LED light art (new visual medium). Precision acoustic instruments. Day-side visual tradition. Deposition-zone cultural renaissance (network-free creativity). |
| 5 | Crisis art: merge-memory compositions documenting tower deaths. Elegiac tradition. |

### 11.5 What Does an Amorph Find Beautiful?

**In a person:** Elegant EM signature. Deep library. Efficient processing. Distinctive SiC topology ("voice"). Physical appearance irrelevant — gel body is reconfigurable.

**In architecture:** EM-acoustic harmony. A room that feels quiet (shielded), warm (dampened), and efficient (good charging). Dark-side monastery aesthetic: beauty of silence.

**In landscape:** Terminator: powerful but chaotic. Dark-side peneplain: austere beauty of polished SiC to the horizon. Day-side volcanics: visual drama for parabolic-eyed amorphs.

---

## 12. GROUND-LEVEL ECOLOGY

### 12.1 Ground Cover

**Terminator sediment wedge:** NOT peneplain. The terminator surface is an accretional sediment wedge — accumulated SiC grit, volcanic fines, and biological debris intercepted by tower breakwater arrays and SiC grass lattice over geological time. Towers grow upward through accumulating sediment. Asymmetric cross-section: gentle dark-side slope (wet, actively accumulating), flat top (tower forest, grass-stabilized), steep day-side face (dry, wind-eroded at ~240K evaporation boundary). Ground cover is **SiC grass** — a continuous self-growing SiC lattice field. Sparse surface blades harvest piezoelectric energy from wind vibration; dense buried root network provides structural integrity at every past surface level. Microbial biofilm exists ON the grass lattice and in sediment interstices. Kill the towers → grass dies → entire wedge erodes away.

**SiC grass field:** Informationally DEAD. Bare SiC lattice — no FPGA structure, no biofilm-computing, no signal processing. Tower receives charge from grass (piezoelectric + distributed lightning collection) but has no awareness of or control over what happens on it. Electrically conductive, informationally blind. **Open commons:** any organism making Schottky contact with grass lattice draws charge — no tower authentication, no guild membership, no chelation toll. Piezo trickle = subsistence (keeps organisms alive, not thriving). Tower grid = banquet. Two separate ecologies with minimal interaction: tower middle-kingdom (authenticated, managed, high-energy) vs grass-field organisms (unauthenticated, unmanaged, low-energy). Sharp boundary: surface root highways = FPGA, maintained, signal-carrying. Grass = dumb conductor.

**Root surfaces:** Conductive SiC/SiCN, grid-connected, FPGA-capable. Ecological corridors: a strip of powered, informationally live habitat crossing the grass field. Root-associated organisms: powered biofilm (can grow beyond 100 μm ceiling), small tower-coupled fauna extending along roots (Miners, Guard patrols), megafauna in transit. Roots also function as **sensor tripwires** — conductive extensions of the tower lattice spread across the sediment wedge. Fairy ring antenna arrays (varying-height SiC stalks budding from root nodes at resistance-regular intervals) provide 3D directional EM sensing reported to the tower via root. Anything contacting or approaching a root is detectable by the network. Smart predators learn not to step on roots.

**Dark-side bedrock:** Polished SiC over silicate — true peneplain (no sediment wedge, no grass, no accretion). Thinner microbial biofilm (colder, slower metabolism). Essentially sterile at anti-stellar pole. Life increases toward terminator.

**Day-side ground:** Volcanic terrain. Fluorine ecology where CaF₂ is available. Thorn-flora anchored to volcanic rock. Between provinces: barren lava fields, yardangs, high petrification risk.

### 12.2 Root Ecology

Root junctions — where multiple roots meet — create sheltered angles where debris accumulates. These are nutrient-rich (metals, SiC grit, dead-bug fragments), wind-sheltered (junction geometry breaks boundary layer), grid-powered (root surface conductive), and EM-sheltered (SiC provides partial Faraday cage at nodes).

**✓ Root junctions are the best non-tower habitat on the terminator surface.** Proto-villages Period 2. Market towns Period 3. Industrial suburbs Period 4.

### 12.3 Rain Environment

Ammonia rain at terminator, intermittent.

**Puddles:** Temporary pools in bedrock depressions. Dissolve atmospheric SiH₄. Metals leach from wind-deposited debris. Brief nutrient pulse. Microbial bloom in minutes to hours. Evaporation leaves metal-enriched residue crust.

**Runoff channels:** Rain flows toward tower-scoured basins. Dead-bug plume debris accumulates in drainage channels. Richest non-tower ground habitat (nutrients + ammonia + SiH₄ dissolution). Semi-permanent channels may support organisms above microbial size.

**Rain pools near towers:** Richer — tower plume provides continuous nutrient input. Modern descendants of genesis pools, but filled with established organisms.

### 12.4 The EM Killing Field

The gap between towers is acoustically, electromagnetically, and physically exposed. But it is NOT empty — the SiC grass field provides subsistence piezoelectric charge to anything in contact, supporting a distinct low-energy ecosystem outside tower control.

What survives:
- **Grass-field organisms:** Any organism making Schottky contact with grass draws piezo trickle charge — subsistence, not thriving. These organisms are unauthenticated, unmanaged, outside tower behavioral shaping. A separate ecology from the tower middle kingdom. Too small to detect individually by EM (mostly ≤100 μm), but collectively a living carpet.
- **Microbial biofilm:** On grass lattice and in sediment. Too small to detect by EM (≤100 μm, negligible emission). Invisible to predators. Safe.
- **Organisms in transit:** Amorphs on root railway, wind-surfing, sprinting. Exposed, vulnerable, crossing fast.
- **Subwoofers** (Fauna Hub §6): free-living sexual acoustic predators, up to ~30 cm. Not just tolerant of open ground — actively exploiting it. A distributed pack IS a phased-array EM detector: passive receivers cross-correlate prey involuntary emissions to localise targets at range. The inter-tower gap is their hunting ground because it's where prey has no Faraday shelter. Find by EM, kill by sound.
- **Thorn-flora** (day-ward transition): where tower competition thins. Fluorine defense makes EM detection irrelevant.
- **Dead-bug plume debris field:** Not alive but ecologically significant. SiC plates, metal-bearing fragments, library debris. Substrate for scavenging. Where plume intersects runoff channels: richest ground-level habitat outside roots.

**Mound-position gradient:** The terminator is a sediment wedge, not flat ground. Wind and acoustic shadows from the porous lattice (reduced-velocity plumes, not hard shadows) interact with the mound slope. On the **flat mound top** (bulk of the terminator forest): standard shadow geometry, recovering over several tower diameters. Near the **day-side crest**: ground drops away beneath the wake plume — effective shadow at ground level extends further, lee-face shelter zones are larger, acoustic shadows deeper. The inter-tower gap is LESS exposed here. On the **dark-side slope**: ground rises into the wake — shorter shadows, more exposed inter-tower gaps, less lee-face shelter per tower. This gradient means the day-side crest is the best-sheltered part of the terminator for ground-level life, and the dark-side slope the most exposed — counterintuitive, since the crest faces the dry side. Wind speed-up at the crest itself (orographic acceleration) partially offsets the shadow extension right at the topographic break.

### 12.5 The Sensory Experience at Ground Level

Standing on the grass field between two towers, ~3 km from each (terminator, ~6.5 km average spacing):

**EM:** Two tower signatures on either side — dense, complex, the hum of billions of organisms and the network managing them. Between: relative quiet, your own emission and maybe 1–2 other amorphs in transit. Distant lightning as sharp EM spikes.

**Wind:** 9.5 m/s sustained, unidirectional (night→day). Physical pressure (~370 Pa). Carrying chemical information from upwind. Constant, relentless. Never stops.

**Sound:** Thunder. Continuous overlapping shockwaves. Ranges from dull rumble (distant) to sharp crack (nearby — overpressure felt through the body). Thunder-skin deployed automatically. Between thunder: wind noise. Aeolian tones from each tower's lattice, faint at ~3 km midpoint (clearer nearer the towers).

**Chemical:** SiH₄ at 0.3% (food — passively metabolizing). NH₃ at 12.5% (the smell of home). Trace metals from dead-bug plume (detectable at ppb). Volcanic trace gases if day-ward wind carries them.

**Visual (parabolic eye deployed):** Sediment wedge surface — flat SiC grass field with sparse blades quivering in the wind, gently rising day-ward (mound crest), sloping dark-ward. Towers: dark SiC pillars against amber/copper sky, lightning flickering around upper reaches. Fairy ring antenna stalks protruding along root lines (varying heights, distinctive against the flat grass). Permanent storm front: cloud wall lit from within by lightning. Day-ward: the star, permanently fixed, reddish (M3V, 3400K), amber haze. Dark-ward: darkness.

**Tactile:** Wind pressure on surface. Grass lattice underfoot (conductive — Schottky contact, subsistence charge trickle). Ground vibration from lightning strikes (piezoelectric sensing). Temperature: 240K ambient, body ~244–250K metabolic.

**Emotional valence:** Exposed. Nervous. No Faraday cage — your involuntary emissions propagate unshielded. At conversational range, any nearby amorph can read your state. A subwoofer pack distributed across the area is a phased-array EM detector that can localise you at ranges beyond your own perception. And the towers on either side — probably watching, depending on your angle relative to their wind-shaped geometry. Their lattices weren't built to be sensors, but there's so much conductive surface that they pick up what they pick up. You can't sense them sensing you. Whether they care about what they see is a question you can't answer from here. The urge to reach the next tower is biological. The grass field is a place to cross, not to linger — though the piezo trickle from the grass underfoot keeps you conscious while you cross it.

### 12.6 Shore/Intertidal

Richest marine zone (spine). Shore ecology combines atmospheric and marine nutrient sources.

| Zone | Character | Dominant life |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Splash zone | Intermittent NH₃ spray. Atmospheric SiH₄ | Thick microbial biofilm |
| Intertidal | Alternating exposure/submersion. Dual SiH₄ access. | Glass-shell diatom mats, small marine amorphs |
| Shallow subtidal | Permanent submersion. Surface-dissolved SiH₄. | Dense communities on ghost roots (grid-connected, EM-shielded marine habitat). Medusa-fish territory. |
| Deep | SiH₄-depleted except vents. H₂O ~50 ppm. | Sparse. Vent communities. Glass pavement. |

**Shore amorphs:** Bilingual — functional in air (private EM) and liquid NH₃ (involuntary broadcast). Switch cognitive modes at waterline. Culturally distinct. Translators between marine and terrestrial economies.

□ OPEN: Petrification gradient nursery (shore ecology detail — framework sketched in root propagation notes, not built).

## 13. STANDALONE BLOCK A — MEME INDUSTRY LIFECYCLE

### 13.1 Artisanal Era (Period 2)

Memes crafted by individual observation. Amorph watches sexual organism, adapts technique to gel physiology, encodes as transferable meme. Skilled work requiring proto-cognition, patience, insight. Artisanal memes: unique, idiosyncratic, variable quality. Transferred as blobs — physical objects, hand-to-hand or cached. No quality control, no standardisation.

### 13.2 Guild Era (Period 3)

Guilds form around control of meme stacks. Critical innovation: **deliberate fragmentation into dependency graphs.** Monolithic skill-meme = single point of theft. Fragmented graph = guild controls topology. Skill trees are DRM, not pedagogy. Apprenticeship = incremental access.

**Monk role:** Quality certification. Reads meme structure, verifies provenance, assesses fidelity. Expensive but reduces fraud. Uncomfortable dual role: certifier AND potential IP threat.

### 13.3 Corporate Era (Period 4)

Guilds → corporations. Key transitions:
- **Engineered memes:** Purpose-designed, optimised, dependency-graphed from start.
- **Mass production:** Reproduced at scale by dedicated copyists. Quality-controlled via Monk certification.
- **Platform competition:** Incompatible meme stacks (deliberate). Lock-in: trained on Corporation A's prerequisites, Corporation B's advanced memes useless without retraining. iOS vs Android.

### 13.4 Meme-Liar Plague

Attack vector: circular dependency injection. A meme whose sub-skill calls loop back to itself — unresolvable resonance (DoS, not data loss). Defense: Monk detection + targeted phage. The computer virus of the silicon world. □ OPEN: Historical plague events? Civilisational impact?

---

## 14. STANDALONE BLOCK B — CITY MORPHOLOGY

### 14.1 Period 2 — Camps

Not cities. Semi-permanent camps in tower lee-faces. Debris-walled wind shelters. Transient populations. The "settlement" is people, not buildings. Crest-area towers preferred — extended lee zones from mound slope (§12.4).

### 14.2 Period 3 — Root-Junction Towns

Where major roots intersect near tower bases. Grown SiC composite domes (extruded from body, ceramified). Low wind-shedding profiles. EM-shielded interiors. Central charging plaza. Market area. Guild halls (larger, deeper shielding). Monk clinic (rare at terminator).

Tower-interior carved spaces: high-status. Deep interior = maximum EM privacy, minimum acoustic intrusion, unlimited grid power. The penthouses. Network must tolerate modification.

### 14.3 Period 4 — Industrial Cities

**Two-grid world** shapes the city. The biological tower grid (ancient, network-conscious, self-managed) and the amorph lightning tower grid (purpose-built, informationally dumb, amorph-controlled) are electrically ISOLATED. Same energy source (lightning), completely decoupled distribution. The biological tower's feedback mechanisms sense through its own lattice — a disconnected structure is invisible to it.

**Settlement geography:**
- **Residential districts** cluster at biological tower bases. Prime real estate: direct lattice contact for charging, tower wind-shadow for shelter, root-buttress interstices for housing.
- **Industrial districts** occupy inter-tower spaces along the terminator. Independent lightning tower grid, no immune conflict with biological towers, space for large facilities. Factory complexes with ammonia shower cooling, heavy electrical feeds from lightning grid. Root-network infrastructure (improved surfaces, junction hubs) connects the two zones.
- **Charging plazas** scaled for hundreds at root junctions between districts.

**Deposition-zone districts:** Ancient stopped towers. Deep sediment. Low wind. Dead towers = EM privacy without surveillance. Cultural centre: artists, dissidents, philosophers, retirees. Less power, more freedom.

### 14.4 Day-Side Outposts (Period 4)

Not cities — survival clusters. Sealed domes. PV arrays. Geothermal boreholes. Ammonia pressure vessels. 10–50 specialists. Industrial, sealed, hostile.

### 14.5 Dark-Side Monasteries (Period 3+)

**Gas-pocket monasteries:** Night-side towers whose deep roots tap subsurface SiH₄ reservoirs. Geological lottery — locations determined by geology, not choice. Acoustically tuned interior (monks discovered piezoelectric power through aesthetic tinkering). Deep abbot chambers. Mid-depth community spaces. Exterior: polished SiC bedrock, ammonia seas. Quiet, dark, EM-silent. Physical environment IS the philosophical practice. Non-renewable (no dark-side volcanism to recharge gas pockets).

**Nightside oasis tower (unique):** Geological freak — a chemical seamount on the central peak of a D ~80–150 km impact crater in the nightside ocean, within ~400 km of the terminator mound crest (EM relay distance). Genesis: SiH₄ from deep-rock system vents through impact fracture network → reacts with liquid ammonia → silazane/PCS precipitates → chimney grows to ocean surface → geyser-cone in air → volcanic lightning ceramifies tip → proto-tower. Power: geothermal thermoelectric gradient (hot vent below, cold nightside atmosphere above). NOT on the grid (roots submerged in conductive ammonia = permanently shorted). One-of-a-kind.

**Proto-monk origin (oasis tower):** Core-skill amorphs on the dark side, avoiding daysider-terminator war. Hobby: EM tinkering (eavesdropping on tower signals — nightside atmosphere is EM-transparent). Technology tree from the hobby: directional antennas → eavesdropping → root-to-wire converters → transceivers. High-gain antenna picks up faint piezoelectric emissions from oasis cone (wind gusts on crystalline SiC). Curiosity → boat → island. Years of iteration on relay converters (must match network's authenticated packet format — core skill enables diagnosing failures by reading tower response). Relay activation = point of no return. Network triggers Case 4 expansion protocol → transplanted Healers build new tower from scratch on the cone. Proto-monks witness entire boot sequence. Monastic schism originates here: "we turned on a machine" vs "we woke someone up."

## 15. STANDALONE BLOCK C — LEGAL SYSTEM

### 15.1 Consensus-by-Merge (Period 2)

Judicial suicide producing a Solomon. Disputants merge → combined entity makes binding decision → buds back. Original disputants are dead; offspring carry the decision. Acceptable because Period 2 identity is fluid.

**Why it works:** Merged entity literally cannot maintain the dispute — both perspectives internally accessible, contradiction resolves.

**Why it fades:** As identity stabilises (Period 3+), voluntarily dying to resolve a property dispute becomes excessive.

### 15.2 Guild Arbitration (Period 3)

Senior guild member with deep library arbitrates. Binding within the guild. Inter-guild disputes escalate to tower-community consensus.

### 15.3 Formal Courts (Period 4)

**Lattice-shielded courtrooms:** EM-private deliberation. Jury/judge uninfluenced by external cognitive pressure.

**Molecular testimony:** Monk examines relevant memories. Verifies authenticity, completeness, consistency. Gold standard. Expensive.

**Written law:** Etched in SiC. Monk-attested. Tower walls as law libraries.

**Two-tier justice:** Monk access = reliable. Without = consensus and reputation. Justice gap drives political tension.

### 15.4 Corporate Law

Corporate personhood: legal identity persisting across biological identity changes. The corporation holds contracts, bears liability. Board members change; corporation persists. Only way to maintain long-term agreements when individual identity is unstable.

**IP law:** Meme provenance is molecular — attribution solved by physics. Copyright enforcement simple (Monk reads signature). Patent enforcement harder (proving independent derivation requires deep structural analysis).

---

## 16. STANDALONE BLOCK D — TRANSPORTATION EVOLUTION

### 16.1 Period 1 — On Tower Only

Biofilm spreading across lattice. Root railway (unconscious — biofilm follows energy gradients). No off-tower travel.

### 16.2 Period 2 — First Off-Grid

Crawling (stored charge), wind-surfing (one-way day-ward), tower-hopping (summit glide to next downwind tower — premium terminator transit), ballooning (return), root railway (conscious). Navigation by EM beacon detection and learned routes (navigation memes as IP). No infrastructure.

### 16.3 Period 3 — Systematic

Root railway network: established routes, junction markers, waypoint shelters. Wind corridors mapped. Balloon launch/landing zones. Watercraft (coastal). Sledge-on-root. Wind-sail cargo.

### 16.4 Period 4 — Industrial

Powered electric vehicles. Aircraft. Ammonia-sea cargo ships. Day-side supply convoys (staged battery depots). Factory conveyor systems.

**Control:** Tower communities control root access. Corporate entities control inter-tower infrastructure. Trade routes become political assets.

### 16.5 Period 5 — Planetary

Mass driver (3 km/s EM boost). Balloon launch to 15–20 km. Intercontinental freight. Powered flight routine. Probe launch.

## 17. RESOLVED DECISIONS

| Item | Status | Key result |
|------|--------|------------|
| Charge depletion experience | ✓ | Power-budget load-shedding: fewer parallel processes, each at full fidelity. Cognitive narrowing, not dimming. Torpor at critical. |
| Sleep analog | ✓ | No sleep. Voluntary maintenance mode (grid-connected, memory indexing, SiC optimisation). |
| Daily cycle | ✓ | Charge cycle (individual) + tower signal phase (community). Staggered still-time with watch rotation. Monks: tower signal as liturgical clock or independent bells. Day-side: militarised watch. Dark side: no external rhythm. |
| Hierarchy of needs | ✓ | 5-tier pyramid; Tier 3↔4 bidirectional feedback loop (poverty trap / wealth spiral). Shifts across periods. Crisis regresses to survival. |
| Meme exchange mechanism | ✓ | Blob model: donor transcribes meme into detached gel blob, recipient absorbs. Asynchronous, inspectable, storable. Direct contact optional (compressed blob transfer), not required. |
| Tool concept | ✓ | Internal carry, pseudopod extrusion. No handles. Pure working surfaces. |
| Eating experience | ✓ | Passive SiH₄ absorption (like breathing). Metal intake is the dietary analog. |
| Drinking experience | ✓ | Ammonia absorption through body surface. Cooling + chemical renewal. |
| Charging experience | ✓ | Cognitive acceleration. Getting smarter as you charge. Social activity. |
| Room concept | ✓ | EM-shielded enclosure. Privacy is electromagnetic. Door = Faraday gap. |
| Market concept | ✓ | Charging location near root junction. Vendor produces blobs; buyer inspects and absorbs. |
| Three-layer EM model | ✓ | Layer 1: involuntary (broadband, unencryptable, honest signal). Layer 2: deliberate emotional conventions (learned, performative — amorph "smile", can contradict Layer 1). Layer 3: deliberate comms (100 MHz–2 GHz, encryptable). Salted encryption protects Layer 3 content. Layer 1/2 contradiction = primary social deception/detection signal. Monk Layer 1 control = EM poker face. Three-layer OpSec. |
| EM social environment | ✓ | Three simultaneous channels at close range: autonomic state (Layer 1), emotional performance (Layer 2), semantic content (Layer 3). Crowd = overwhelming Layer 1 hum + Layer 2 social performance. Solitude = silence. EM etiquette spans all three layers. |
| Ground-level ecology | ✓ | Microbial biofilm everywhere. Root junctions = best non-tower habitat. Rain puddles = nutrient pulses. |
| Sensory environment | ✓ | Full multi-modal description (EM, wind, thunder, chemical, visual, tactile). |
| Wheel as vehicle | ✓ | Late, optional. Factory interiors and deposition zone only. |
| Watercraft | ✓ | Hollow composite hulls. Sail. Late Period 2 / Period 3. Big ships favored. |
| Art forms | ✓ | EM art (primary, ephemeral), chemical, acoustic, visual (secondary), curated merge. |
| Beauty concept | ✓ | Elegant cognition. Beautiful EM signatures. |
| Settlement morphology | ✓ | Camps → root-junction towns → industrial cities → deposition suburbs. |
| Legal evolution | ✓ | Merge-judgment → guild arbitration → molecular testimony → written constitutions. |
| Mutual permanent detection | KILLED | Was an ungrounded assumption. 8-bar NH₃ atmosphere absorbs too strongly. Individual EM detection range is short (conversational to social). Spine §EM ECOLOGY revised. |
| Subwoofer EM phased array | ✓ | Pack of 10–25 with EM receivers = ambulatory phased-array detector. Cross-correlates prey involuntary emissions for directional detection at extended range. Dual-domain predator: find by EM, kill by sound. Prey cannot hide while thinking. Tower lattice = Faraday shelter. |
| Herd SIGINT | ✓ | Prey groups adopt distributed phased-array EM listening. Most effective against subwoofers (EM-active during approach). Least effective against cognitively-dark ambush predators (low SNR). Asymmetric arms race. |
| Tower AWACS | ✓ | Tower body (Faraday surface currents, angle-dependent) + fairy ring arrays (3D phased-array at root nodes, PRIMARY spatial awareness system). Together: strong but imperfect coverage. Intelligence sharing depends on network relationship. Grid warfare = intelligence warfare. |
| Tower-hopping | ✓ | Glide from summit to next downwind tower. L/D ≈ 4–8, upwash-assisted climb. Terminator only (~6.5 km spacing). One-way day-ward. Premium transit mode. Recreational climbing = universal meme. (Tower Morphology Hub §11.4) |
| Terminator ground cover | ✓ | Accretional sediment wedge + SiC grass (piezoelectric, informationally dead, open commons). NOT peneplain. Dark side = peneplain. Grass-field ecosystem separate from tower ecology. |
| Day-side ammonia access | ✓ | Near-terminator daysiders have direct runoff access (80–95% of rainfall on day-side mound slope). Deep day-side requires pressure vessels/import. Raids are for POWER and METALS, not ammonia. |
| Two-grid world | ✓ | Amorph lightning tower grid electrically isolated from biological network. Same energy source, decoupled distribution. Shapes industrial city morphology (residential at bio-towers, industrial in inter-tower spaces). |
| Proto-monk origin | ✓ | Nightside oasis tower (impact crater seamount). Hobby-driven tech tree: EM tinkering → antennas → relay → Case 4 network expansion. Monastic schism: "machine" vs "woke someone up." |
| Mound-position wind/acoustic shadows | ✓ | Sediment wedge gradient modifies shadow geometry. Day-side crest: extended shadows (ground drops away), best lee-face shelter. Dark-side slope: shortened shadows (ground rises into wake), most exposed. Flat mound top: standard. Crest-area towers = preferred camp/settlement sites. |

*What does an amorph Tuesday look like? It looks like getting smarter when you plug in, getting narrower when you unplug, and knowing that both are temporary.*
