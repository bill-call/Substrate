# SESSION PROMPT: Amorph Emergence — Pore-Dweller to Surface Megafauna

## Setup

Follow CLAUDE.md session protocol. Load spine (`substrate_spine.md`). Additionally load:
- Root Propagation Notes (`substrate_root_propagation_notes.md`) §1, §5, §10e — sponge-reactor genesis, the gap statement
- Pool Genesis Hub §2–§3 — coacervation, dual-origin fork, diffusion-limited energy budget (≤100 μm)
- Memory Architecture Hub — meme architecture, working memory, federation (the END STATE we must reach)
- Chemistry Hub §4 (lattice mineral), §6 (carbosilane pathway) — the material environment

Load on demand (not pre-loaded):
- Fauna Structural Hub — if discussing body plan mechanics
- Amorph Economics Hub — if discussing charge economy, power constraints
- Skywhale Hub §3 (amorph membrane model) — if discussing amorph body plan at scale

## Context: What's Established

### The starting point (resolved, do not re-derive)

- **Sponge-reactor genesis.** Both lineages (amorphs, sexuals) originate in PCS/SiC sponge pore spaces filling fracture-connected ammonia pools at the terminator. Lightning-driven PECVD in confined pores with catalytic walls and ammonia solvent produces complex molecules. The sponge is a self-targeting lightning reactor (H₂ waste plume guides strikes).
- **Lineage fork.** Coacervation (concentration-dependent phase separation, favored in confined pores) → amorphs. Amphiphile self-assembly → sexuals. Chemical fork, geometrically sorted: amorphs stay in lattice (reconfigurable, fit tortuous pores), sexuals exported to open water (rigid body, squeezed out as pores narrow).
- **Amorph starting state.** ≤100 μm. Catalytic chemistry (metallosilazane enzymes). No fixed body plan. Reconfigurable. Living in SiC lattice pore spaces. No genome — catalytic patterns only. Minimal cognition.
- **Sexuals solved.** Exported to open water → adaptive radiation → tower symbiotes (re-colonize lattice from outside) and medusa-fish (marine apex predator). Genomic evolution, fast. This path is established.

### The end state (resolved, do not re-derive)

- **Surface megafauna amorphs.** Macroscopic (kg-scale or larger). Mobile on open terrain. SiC stock for variable rigidity. Gel actuators (~5 kPa). Parabolic reflector eye (meme-transferable). Working memory (semiconductor neurology, grid-powered). Meme architecture (signed catalytic patterns = intellectual property). Federation (elite athletic skill). Charge-limited ecology (power rate, not energy). Interact with towers from OUTSIDE — energy-gradient tropism for tower management.
- **Tower relationship.** Amorphs are megafauna transport layer, not colonization couriers. They manage towers via energy-gradient tropism. They are the tower's cognitive complement — the network processes signals, the amorphs provide mobile intelligence. Mutualism.

### The gap

**No established mechanism connects these two states.** The transition involves:

1. **Scale:** ≤100 μm → macroscopic. Orders of magnitude in mass. What drives growth? What provides energy for growth? Is it continuous or staged?
2. **Environment:** Confined lattice pore → open surface. At what point does an amorph leave the lattice interior? Does it grow large inside the lattice first, or leave small and grow outside?
3. **Energy:** Pore-dwelling amorphs may tap the lattice grid (Schottky coupling, like the sexuals who become symbiotes). Surface megafauna amorphs are charge-limited and depend on tower charging stations. When/how does the energy relationship change?
4. **Cognition:** Pore-dwellers have minimal catalytic chemistry. Surface megafauna have working memory, meme architecture, semiconductor neurology. When does cognition emerge? Is it lattice-dependent (grid-powered from the start) or does it develop independently?
5. **Mobility:** Pore-dwellers are sessile or minimally motile within pore spaces. Surface megafauna are mobile on open terrain with gel actuators. What's the locomotion sequence?
6. **Body plan:** Amorphs have no fixed body plan — that's definitional. But a ≤100 μm blob and a kg-scale variable-rigidity organism with sensory organs are very different things. What structural innovations occur along the way?

## Constraints to Respect

- No genome. Amorphs evolve via meme transcription errors only. Any proposed mechanism must work WITHOUT genomic evolution. This is the hard constraint — the transition must be achievable through catalytic chemistry and environmental selection acting on meme variation, not genomic adaptation.
- Meme evolution is slow (orders of magnitude slower than sexual genomic evolution). The transition timescale must be consistent with this rate.
- The lattice is the amorph's ancestral environment. Any mechanism should feel continuous with the sponge-pore starting point, not require a miraculous leap.
- Charge-limited ecology: amorphs can't grow beyond what their power budget supports. Thinking draws power. Larger body = more maintenance. The economics must close.
- Merge is DESTRUCTIVE (N→1). Budding is CONSTRUCTIVE (parents persist). Do not propose merge-growth as a scaling mechanism unless the destructive cost is accounted for.
- Tower-coupled symbiotes (Healers, Miners, Guards) are SEXUALS, not amorphs. Do not confuse the two lineages.

## Possible Angles (not prescriptive — explore freely)

- **Lattice channel gradient.** The 5 zones/strut have different flow characteristics and channel sizes. Outer zones have larger spaces. Could amorphs migrate outward through the lattice to progressively larger channels, growing as they go? The lattice as a size-selective habitat gradient.
- **Tower surface as nursery.** The lattice exterior surface is where Healers work — it's biologically active, grid-powered, has atmospheric SiH₄ flow. Could amorphs emerge at the lattice surface and grow in this environment before becoming free-living?
- **Wind-driven export.** The terminator wind (9.5 m/s, 8 bar) flows through the lattice. Small organisms at the lattice surface could be entrained in the wind and deposited elsewhere. Dispersal mechanism.
- **SiC stock accumulation.** Amorphs use redistributable SiC for variable rigidity. A pore-dwelling amorph in an SiC lattice has abundant SiC. Could it accumulate SiC stock from lattice dissolution or debris, gradually building structural mass?
- **Grid-powered growth.** If pore-dwelling amorphs tap the grid via Schottky coupling, they have energy for growth. Larger size = more coupling area = more power = more growth. Positive feedback — but eventually they outgrow the pore and must leave.

## Output

Develop a plausible, physics-grounded mechanism for the amorph pore-to-surface transition. The mechanism should:
1. Be continuous (no miraculous leaps, no "and then somehow they got big")
2. Be inevitable (given a Gy of opportunity, this WILL happen)
3. Close the energy budget at every stage
4. Explain WHEN cognition emerges (this matters for the narrative)
5. Connect to the established end state (charge-limited megafauna, tower mutualism)

Flag any points where the mechanism requires decisions beyond this session's scope.

Keep the user's preferences: technical peer interaction, pushback when warranted, no ego-boosting.
