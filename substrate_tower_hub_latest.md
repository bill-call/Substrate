**SUBSTRATE --- TOWER HUB**

The convergence document. Load with spine for any tower-focused session.

Dependencies: SPINE (required). No other modules needed unless going
deep on a specific subsystem.

WHAT THE TOWER IS

A tower is a surface eruption of the deep-rock organism. It is
simultaneously: a biological colony (symbiote), a mineral structure
(lattice), a power grid (conductive), a signal network (computation), an
ecosystem (reef), a lung (gas exchange), a lightning rod, a
civilization's home, and a launch platform. Every system on this planet
intersects at the tower. The tower is the nexus.

ORIGIN

**✓** Towers grow UP from the deep-rock organism. They are not built by
surface life. The root network is not infrastructure towers constructed
--- it is the organism the towers grew out of.

Deep-rock chemolithotrophic colony reaches the atmosphere through
fracture networks. Surface-facing organisms encounter atmospheric SiH₄
--- vastly richer energy than geothermal H₂. Metabolism accelerates.
Conductive mineral deposition accelerates. Deposits build upward into
the silane gradient and toward the star's photons. A tower nucleates.

**✓** Every independent deep-rock colony that reaches the surface
evolves towers independently. Convergent --- identical atmosphere, star
spectrum, mineral chemistry, gas-diffusion constraints, semiconductor
bandgap all force near-identical gross morphology. Signal protocols are
incompatible across colonies. Lattice microstructure varies (different
symbiote lineages). From outside: indistinguishable. From inside: alien.

STRUCTURE AND GROWTH

**The Coral Model**

**✓** Living layer is SUBSURFACE: mm to cm below the exterior surface.
Symbiote colony deposits mineral onto the lattice from within.

Three concentric zones: (1) Sacrificial crust --- outermost, dead,
ablated by wind. Mineral only. (2) Living layer --- active symbiote.
Metabolizing, depositing, signaling. (3) Structural lattice ---
innermost, permanent, conductive. Accumulating over geological time. The
crust is bark. The living layer is cambium. The lattice is heartwood.

**✓** Self-regulating thickness equilibrium: wind erosion removes crust
at rate determined by wind speed. Symbiote deposits new mineral from
within. Equilibrium thickness = deposition rate / erosion rate. Shifts
by zone: thinner crust at terminator (high erosion), thicker on dark
side (low erosion).

**The Lung**

**✓** Lattice is porous. Open architecture. Wind flows through, not
around. Atmospheric SiH₄ diffuses inward from leeward/interior surfaces
to feed the symbiote layer.

This is gas exchange, not ventilation --- passive diffusion, not pumped.
The lattice geometry that produces strength and conductivity also
produces the pore structure needed for gas transport. Single structure
serving three functions (structural, conductive, respiratory).

**✓** Maximum tower diameter limited by gas diffusion path length.
Center of a too-wide tower starves. Terminator towers: tall and narrow
(high silane flux, high wind, rapid diffusion). Dark-side towers: short
and wide (low silane flux, low wind, slow diffusion).

**Scale**

Terminator towers: up to \~1 km tall. Narrow. Closely spaced. Rapidly
nucleating. Geologically young (continuously replaced by migration).
Dark-side towers: shorter, wider, older, more widely spaced.
Deposition-zone towers: ancient terminator migrants that stopped when
wind dropped below erosion threshold. The largest and oldest intact
towers. Anti-stellar pole: the most ancient. Billions of years of
uninterrupted accretion. Complete mineral record of planetary history.

**Lattice Properties**

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
  Conductivity           Physical property of the mineral. Not
                         biologically maintained. Dead lattice still
                         conducts.

  Signals                Require living network. Dead lattice =
                         silent conductor.

  Acoustics              Wind through porous lattice produces tonal
                         vibration. Each tower has a voice. Changes
                         with biological coating.

  Photovoltaics          Symbiote surface layer has semiconductor
                         properties. Star's 850 nm peak matches Si
                         bandgap. Native solar cells.

  Piezoelectricity       Lattice vibration in wind generates
                         current. Dominates at terminator.

  Lightning capture      Km-tall conductive lattice grounded through
                         root network. Every nearby discharge hits a
                         tower. Energy + chemical feedstock
                         harvested.
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------

THE TOWER AS ECOSYSTEM

The tower is a reef. Every surface colonized. Population density exceeds
a termite mound. The energy grid (lattice current) powers an entire
biome that exists nowhere else on the planet.

**The Grid**

Piezoelectric + photovoltaic + lightning energy flows through the
conductive lattice as current. The tower is a permanently powered
electrical grid. Middle-kingdom organisms (mm-scale, rigid, genomic,
sexual) tap this grid parasitically: inductive coupling, direct contact,
piezoelectric harvesting of lattice vibration. They carry no metabolic
machinery for self-powered energy. Without the grid, they die.

**Tower Fauna Tiers**

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
  Microbial films        Amorph. Coat every surface. Baseline
                         ecosystem. Decomposers, chemotrophs.

  Middle kingdom         Genomic/sexual. mm-scale. Fixed to lattice
  (sessile)              junctions for life. MAJORITY of tower
                         biomass. Die in place.

  Middle kingdom         Genomic/sexual. mm--cm scale. Grazers,
  (mobile)               predators, dispersal morphs. Insect-scale
                         arms races (Voronoi armor, railgun
                         micropenetrators). MINORITY.

  Small amorphs          Catalytic. Self-powered. Can leave tower.
                         Surfers, dispersal agents, fluorine
                         pollinators (near volcanic provinces).

  Megafauna amorphs      Catalytic. Self-powered. Free-ranging. The
                         civilized inhabitants. Too large to surf
                         safely.
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------

**Network Management of Tower Fauna**

Middle kingdom: EM field modulation → tropism. Crude. Galvanotaxis,
phototaxis. Hardware peripherals steered by field changes. No cognition
required from the organism.

Amorphs: subtle behavioral EM signals integrated with semiconductor
cognition. Feels like own thoughts. Manipulated without knowing it. This
is how the network managed its biosphere for billions of years before
the awakening.

**Dead-Bug Plume [NEW IN V2.4]**

Garbage-collector Healer sub-caste clears dead symbiotes from the
lattice (maintains airflow + conductivity). Dead organisms pushed to
exterior enter the windstream and are carried day-ward as a continuous
plume from every tower. Terminator rain captures most of the plume;
dead material accumulates in ammonia runoff drainage channels.
This plume is a resource stream: SiC plates (~5mm), catalytic metals
(time-limited before petrification locks them), library fragments
(very time-limited). Airborne interception and ammonia runoff filtering
are ecological niches and pre-industrial amorph industries.

**⚠** Day-side towers: impossible at scale. Volcanism continuously
resurfaces the day side; terminator rain strips building materials
from the airstream before they reach the day side. Small/short-lived
day-side towers only.

**Biodiversity Gradient**

Wind carries organisms downwind continuously. Every tower's biology =
residents + wind-delivered arrivals. Terminator towers: young, recently
nucleated, seeded by lightning-zone abiogenesis. Deposition-zone towers:
billions of years of accumulated wind-delivered biology from the entire
terminator front. Richest biodiversity in the deposition zone. Thinnest
at the terminator.

THE TOWER IN THE WIND

**Erosion and Migration**

**✓** Towers migrate day-ward via differential erosion/accretion
(sand-dune mechanism). Windward face: wind strips sacrificial crust,
exposes living layer, symbiote deposits replacement. Leeward face:
sheltered from erosion, net deposition outpaces removal. Center of mass
shifts downwind.

Rate: \~mm/year at terminator (needs calibration). Stops: when wind
drops below erosion threshold, in the deposition zone. Ghost roots:
abandoned conductive mineral trails underground behind every migrated
tower. Readable. A fossil archive of migration history.

**✓** Terminator is a tower factory. Towers vacate positions; new
colonies nucleate behind them. Continuous production.

**⚠** Dark-side towers: wind flows pole → terminator, so erosion faces
day-ward, accretion faces pole-ward. May migrate POLEWARD. Unverified.

**Wind-Surfing**

Organisms blown off towers enter the airstream at wind speed. They do
NOT hit the next tower at wind speed --- they are carried IN the wind,
approach the next tower's lattice, enter the wind shadow, decelerate in
turbulent eddies inside the open porous structure. Tumble through
lattice elements losing momentum. Come to rest inside. The lattice is a
catch-net.

Evolved skill: control surfaces, asymmetric gas venting, center-of-mass
shifting. Not flight --- surfing. Read the turbulence, pick the entry
point, land clean. Inherited skill in amorph lineages via merge.

Civilized use: deliberate downwind transit. One-way (always day-ward).
Return journey by balloon (upper-level return flow).

**Falling**

Falls are lethal in 1.82g. At the terminator, falling off = exile or
death for large amorphs. Wind carries you day-ward. No return. The
outermost chambers are where people disappear from. Distance from
windward face has life-or-death dimension.

Small organisms: fall-survival via gas bladder (emergency parachute) is
the evolutionary precursor to balloon flight. The parachute → glider →
balloon pathway begins with falling off a tower and not dying.

**The Windward Face**

Highest erosion, highest energy input (piezoelectric + wind), highest
particulate flux. The loudest, most violent part of the tower. Outermost
passages: noisy, dangerous, socially lowest-status for amorph
inhabitants. Physically closest to the wind. Innermost passages: quiet,
sheltered, high-status.

THE TOWER AS NETWORK NODE

Each tower is a node in the planetary network. The lattice conducts
signals generated by the deep-rock organism below. The root network
connects towers laterally. The network's computation runs through the
lattice the way a nervous system runs through a body.

**Signal Environment**

Inside an active tower, every lattice surface carries current. The
interior is an EM environment --- permeated by the network's signals.
Amorphs living inside experience this as a constant ambient field.
Pre-awakening: perceived as internal impulses, spiritual communion, the
voice of the tower. Post-first-awakening: recognized as external.
Post-second-crisis: recognized as non-conscious.

**Root Connections**

Surface roots: horizontal connections between nearby towers. Evolved to
manage megafauna (behavioral EM signals directing grazer herds,
attracting amorphs to damaged regions). Also carry network signals
between towers. When expanding roots from different colonies meet:
network wars begin (see spine).

Deep roots: the original deep-rock organism. Vertical connections to the
subsurface network. Oldest infrastructure. Carries geothermal energy
upward and network signals in both directions.

**Dead Towers**

A dead tower's lattice still conducts (physical property of the mineral)
but carries no signals. It is electrically live but computationally
silent. No network. No management of fauna. No behavioral signals. The
middle-kingdom fauna lose their power supply and die. The microbial
films persist on chemical reserves briefly then fail.

Dead towers are morally harvestable --- no signals = no network presence
= no ethical barrier to mining the lattice for material. During the
atmospheric crisis: mining the dead to build the probe.

**The Tower's Voice**

Wind through porous lattice produces tonal vibration. Each tower has a
unique acoustic signature determined by lattice geometry, pore
structure, biological coating. Living towers sound different from dead
towers (biological coating damps and modifies resonance). Dark-side
gentle-wind towers: the singing zone. Monks listen.

**The Tower as Acoustic Shelter [NEW IN V2.4]**

Thunder at 8 bar is a shockwave, not merely sound. The terminator's
continuous lightning produces continuous overpressure bombardment —
physically damaging at ranges where Earth thunder is merely loud (Geology
Hub §8, Fauna Hub §5.6). The tower lattice provides critical acoustic
shielding: the porous structure baffles and attenuates shockwaves
progressively with depth. Deep interior chambers are acoustically calm;
the windward face is brutal. This acoustic gradient is a selection
pressure on tower morphology and a driver of interior habitation.
Amorphs live *inside* towers partly because the outside is an acoustic
war zone. The lattice is a lung, a power grid, a fortress, and a
sound-shadow.

THE TOWER AS CIVILIZATION

**Habitation**

Amorphs live inside towers. Architecture is grown, not assembled ---
extruded from the builder's body, fiber-composite post-revolution.
Interior is invisible from outside (within the lattice), blazing with EM
activity within. Every surface potentially a sensor, heater,
communication conduit.

Tower walls = libraries. Writing medium: etched silicon, deposited
conductive traces. Oldest inscriptions millions of years old,
continuously annotated. Living palimpsest.

Dead lining the corridors: petrified ancestors. Glass fossils. The dead
persist because silicon doesn't rot. Architecture includes the dead as
structural/memorial elements.

**Geography of Towers**

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
  Terminator towers      Industrial. Energy-rich. Mining
                         (crisis-killed towers). Manufacturing.
                         Young, tall, narrow, closely spaced.
                         Dangerous (wind, falls).

  Deposition-zone towers Capital. Residential, cultural. Ancient
                         stopped migrants. Largest towers.
                         Comfortable climate. Near industrial base.
                         Launch corridor.

  Dark-side towers       Spiritual. Singing zone. Monks.
                         Contemplatives. Gentle wind, cold, calm.
                         Acoustic richness. Gas-pocket towers =
                         monasteries (non-renewable SiH₄ reserves).

  Anti-stellar pole      Archive. Oldest. Billions of years of
  towers                 uninterrupted mineral record. Complete
                         history. Near-zero wind.
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------

**The Mass Driver**

Post-awakening technology. Electromagnetic accelerator built into/onto a
deposition-zone tower. 10 km tower = above 37% of atmosphere. 3 km/s EM
boost reduces onboard Δv from \~18 to \~15 km/s. Requires network
cooperation (tower is a network node; mass driver draws tower's power).
Network-dependent. Cannot function without the merger.

TOWER DEATH

Before the atmospheric crisis, tower death is vanishingly rare. Towers
do not age. The lattice is mineral. The living layer replaces itself
continuously. Death requires catastrophe: volcanic eruption, sustained
mechanical failure, or atmospheric silane depletion.

The crisis causes the first tower deaths in planetary history. Visible.
Alarming. A structure that has been alive for billions of years goes
silent.

**The Exodus**

When the grid fails, small mobile fauna feel it first (no energy
reserves). Millions of surfers, mobile middle-kingdom organisms, and
small amorphs launch from the leeward face simultaneously. Not
coordinated --- stampede. Every organism independently detecting the
same grid failure. From a distance: the tower exhales a dark shimmering
cloud that stretches downwind for kilometers.

The sessile majority (95%+ of biomass) dies in place. Silent. On the
lattice junctions they were born on. The visible exodus is the tip of a
total systems failure.

The tower's voice changes as biological coating is lost. Acoustic
signature shifts to bare mineral resonance. The amorphs inside hear the
tower dying in its changing song before they see the surfer cloud.

During the crisis: tower-death cascades propagate downwind. A dies,
refugees overload B, B declines, B's surfers flee to C. A domino wave
visible as sequential surfer clouds approaching from the terminator.
Each dying tower seeds its downwind neighbors with biological legacy.

Large amorphs cannot surf. They watch the millions leave and know they
cannot follow. Walk, climb down, or stay and die in a tower going cold
around them.
