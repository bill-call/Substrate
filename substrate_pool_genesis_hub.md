# SUBSTRATE — POOL GENESIS HUB

**v2.4 — February 2026**

**Load with:** Spine (required). Silicon Chemistry Hub §3.5 + §8 (recommended, for void genesis chemistry and catalysis).

Pool genesis is the liquid-phase origin of mobile, replicating life. It complements void genesis (Chemistry Hub §3.5, bible §4.8–4.9), which produces surface-attached, non-replicating towers. **[V2.4+]** Pool genesis is independent of void genesis (mostly independent variables), but tower activity drives pool evolution via catalytic ejecta (see §2.7). Both pathways operate at the terminator; divergence is phase, not geography. This hub covers ammonia-pool abiogenesis, compartmentalization, the amorph/sexual lineage fork, energy constraints, the pool-to-land transition, and the undersea tower scenario that bootstraps symbiosis.

## 1. POOL vs VOID — THE PHASE DIFFERENCE

Both genesis environments share: terminator location, lightning access, atmospheric feedstocks (SiH₄ 0.3%, NH₃ 12.5%, CH₄ 10%), and geothermal input. Divergence is entirely in reaction medium.

| Parameter | Void genesis (→ towers) | Pool genesis (→ mobile life) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Reaction medium | Mineral surface in gas-filled crack | Liquid NH₃ (~660 kg/m³, 240K) |
| Concentration mechanism | Surface accumulation (2D, no dilution) | Phase separation / coacervation (3D) |
| Metal delivery | Leached from local wall rock (slow, parochial) | Dissolved as ammine complexes (fast, diverse) |
| Lightning access | Indirect (products rain down) | Direct (strikes pool surface) |
| Dilution problem | None | Critical — drives compartmentalization |
| Compartmentalization | Unnecessary (surface-attached) | Required (coacervation) |
| Product | Non-replicating lattice organism | Replicating mobile organisms (two lineages) |

See Chemistry Hub §3.5 and bible §4.8 for the deep-rock reaction front and void genesis pathway. This document covers pool genesis only, noting parallels where relevant.

## 2. POOL ENVIRONMENT

### 2.1 Solvent

| Property | Liquid NH₃ at 8 bar, 240K | Water at 1 bar, 293K (comparison) |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| State | Liquid (boils ~290K at 8 bar) | Liquid |
| Density | ~660–680 kg/m³ | 998 kg/m³ |
| Viscosity | ~0.20 mPa·s | 1.00 mPa·s |
| Dielectric constant | ~25 | 80 |
| H-bond strength | N-H···N ≈ 13 kJ/mol | O-H···O ≈ 20 kJ/mol |
| Surface tension | ~23 mN/m | 72 mN/m |
| Autoprotolysis | 2NH₃ ⇌ NH₄⁺ + NH₂⁻ | 2H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + OH⁻ |

✓ NH₃ does not attack Si-Si bonds. It forms Si-N bonds (silazane) — the biological matrix. NH₃ is the biologically compatible solvent; H₂O is the poison (Chemistry Hub §1).

### 2.2 Dissolved Resources

**Metals:** Volcanic basin rock leaches into ammonia as stable ammine complexes:

| Metal | Complex | Source | Biological role (Chemistry Hub §8) |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Nickel | [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺ | Pentlandite, metal sulfides | Si-H/C-H activation, silane metabolism |
| Iron | [Fe(NH₃)₆]²⁺ | Troilite, native iron | Electron transfer, SiC ceramification |
| Cobalt | [Co(NH₃)₆]²⁺/³⁺ | Metal arsenides, sulfides | Si-Si bond formation (polysilane backbone) |
| Titanium | Ti(NH₂)₄ / polymeric Ti-NH species | Ilmenite, rutile | Polymerization, chain extension |

All four biometals available simultaneously in solution. Void genesis gets only what local rock mineralogy provides.

**Silane:** SiH₄ dissolves from the atmosphere at the air-liquid interface. Henry's law equilibrium at 0.024 bar partial pressure. Estimated dissolved concentration: ⚠ ~0.1 mM. Biology consumes dissolved SiH₄ continuously, maintaining undersaturation — the sea is a net silane **sink**, pulling atmospheric SiH₄ inward.

**Lightning products:** Plasma CVD at the air-liquid interface produces aminosilanes (H₂N-SiH₃), methylsilanes (CH₃SiH₃), silazane fragments, and carbosilane fragments. Polar products dissolve immediately; nonpolar products accumulate as surface film. See Chemistry Hub §9.

### 2.3 Hydrothermal Vents

Where fractures intersect the sea floor, vent fluids deliver: concentrated metals (basin-wide hydrothermal budget), geothermal SiH₄ (locally elevated concentration, bypassing the air-liquid dissolution bottleneck), and warm fluid (+5–20K). Vents create metal-rich hotspots that accelerate pool chemistry but are not required for pool genesis.

### 2.4 H₂O Contamination and Genesis Viability

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Silazane hydrolysis (Si-NH-Si + H₂O → Si-O-Si + NH₃) has K ≈ 1.6 × 10⁵ at 240K (Geology Hub §6). Pre-biotic silazane polymers — with no metabolic repair machinery — cannot survive in environments with >6 ppm H₂O. Does trace H₂O kill pool genesis?

**No. The distillation shield protects terminator pools.**

At 240K, NH₃ vapor pressure >> H₂O vapor pressure (~10,000:1). Rain and condensation carry only atmospheric H₂O, which is further suppressed by SiH₄ scavenging pre-crisis. Fresh terminator pools: estimated <1 ppm H₂O.

| Environment | H₂O (ppm) | % silazane hydrolyzed at eq. | Genesis? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh terminator pool | <1 | <14% | ✓ Viable |
| Aged pool (some vent contact) | 1–10 | 14–62% | ⚠ Marginal |
| Open sea (hydrothermal accumulation) | ~50 | ~89% | ✗ Hostile |
| Vent-adjacent sea floor | <5 | <45% | ✓ Locally protected |

The sea concentrates H₂O from hydrothermal injection, meteoritic delivery, and photochemistry over geological time. Fresh pools don't accumulate these non-atmospheric sources.

**Consequences:**
- Pool genesis proceeds in H₂O-poor terminator pools — the distillation shield is sufficient.
- The **pool-to-sea transition** (§6) is the evolutionary bottleneck where anti-petrification defenses must evolve. Every marine lineage passed through this filter.
- Pool-to-land is easier than pool-to-sea from a petrification standpoint: terminator land air has comparable H₂O to the birth pool, while the sea has 50–100× more.
- Vent microenvironments on the sea floor are locally H₂O-depleted (vent fluids passed through reducing mantle, same chemistry that protects void genesis — Chemistry Hub §10.3). This supports undersea reef genesis (§7) in an otherwise hostile sea.

See Chemistry Hub §10.3 for the full thermodynamic analysis. See Geology Hub §6 for petrification kinetics and biological defense.

### 2.5 The Proto-Tower Genesis Reactor

**[REVISED IN V2.4]** An ammonia pool on an open surface is a sediment trap. Atmospheric particulate (volcanic fines + volcanic SiC) falls out wherever wind meets liquid (wave-induced turbulence reduces wind carrying capacity). All particulate sinks in ammonia (solids: 2500–3200 kg/m³ vs ammonia: 660 kg/m³). Pre-biotic silicate terrain erodes at ~600 mm/Myr from combined volcanic SiC (~0.08% of conveyor particulate, ~9 Tg/yr) and silicate abrasion — natural depressions in silicate bedrock are geologically short-lived. See `v2.4_volcanic_sic_analysis.md` for the full quantitative analysis.

The solution is the **proto-tower** — but its relationship to genesis is more complex than simple shelter. The proto-tower is the surface expression of an active deep-rock system with a fracture network. **⚠ REVISED (see §2.7):** The proto-tower is an evolutionary engine, not a genesis reactor. Fracture-connected pools fill too fast for genesis (years to decades via geyser-cone construction; genesis requires My-scale). Genesis occurs in stable non-connected pools; tower byproducts (catalytic ejecta) provide nutrient rain and punctuated disturbance that drive evolution. The force multipliers below remain real but apply primarily to tower construction and indirect pool benefits.

#### Geomorphological Shelter

SiC (Mohs 9.5) resists both silicate abrasion (Mohs 6–7, cannot scratch) and peer-hardness volcanic SiC abrasion (~0.08% of particulate load). Differential erosion ratio: ~100,000:1 (SiC monadnock vs silicate terrain). Monadnock survival without symbiote support: >1 Gyr. With deep-rock SiC deposition from below: actively growing. The proto-tower provides:

1. **Wind shelter.** Lee-side wind shadow where ammonia rain pools.
2. **Gravitational gradient.** Topographic relief creates drainage — flow-through system prevents sediment-filling death.
3. **Roughness for ammonia retention.** Irregular lattice topography (root structures, scour features, rubble) creates many small depressions that hold ammonia.

#### Chemical and Energetic Force Multipliers

The proto-tower's fracture network actively delivers resources that dramatically enhance genesis conditions compared to a generic ammonia pool:

| Force multiplier | Mechanism | Advantage over generic pool |
|---|---|---|
| Geothermal SiH₄ venting | Fracture network carries SiH₄ from depth, vents at tower base | Bypasses atmospheric dissolution bottleneck (~0.1 mM). Locally 10–100× higher dissolved SiH₄ |
| Metal-enriched fluids | Hydrothermal circulation leaches all four biometals (Ni, Fe, Co, Ti) as ammine complexes | Same "metal bonanza" as undersea tower scenario (§7.2) but in a pool. Generic pools get only local rock mineralogy |
| Lightning rod effect | Tallest object on landscape. Lightning preferentially strikes monadnock, products wash into adjacent pools | Concentrates Miller-Urey engine over small liquid volume. Orders of magnitude more product per unit pool volume |
| Warm fluids | Geothermal input through fractures: +5–20K above ambient 240K | 2–5× kinetic acceleration for genesis-relevant reactions (Ea ~50 kJ/mol) |
| N-doped SiC substrate | Pool floor/walls include semiconductor material from deep-rock system | Catalytic surfaces, electrochemical gradients at semiconductor-liquid interface. Silicate substrate is inert |
| Flow-through hydrology | Gravitational drainage from monadnock topography | Continuous fresh ammonia input maintains <1 ppm H₂O, delivers fresh lightning products, creates chemical gradients |
| Micro-pool multiplication | Rough lattice structure creates many pools at different depths, exposures, flow rates, vent proximities | Each monadnock is a rack of parallel experiments with varied conditions, not a single beaker |

**Comparison to the undersea tower scenario (§7):** The proto-tower-base pool combines the advantages of pool genesis (atmospheric SiH₄ access, direct lightning, low H₂O <1 ppm) with the advantages of undersea tower genesis (metal bonanza, vent SiH₄, warm fluids, semiconductor substrate) WITHOUT the undersea scenario's liabilities (50 ppm H₂O, no lightning access, no air-liquid interface). The proto-tower pool is the best of both genesis environments.

#### Preadaptation Gradient Toward Symbiosis

Organisms evolving in the proto-tower's resource shadow develop traits that pre-adapt them for tower symbiosis, even though symbiosis doesn't yet exist as a strategy:

| Preadaptation | Pool-base origin | Symbiote endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| SiC surface contact | Adhesion/catalysis enzymes interact with SiC substrate | Schottky/ohmic junction for energy extraction (§8) |
| Vent SiH₄ dependency | Metabolism tuned to tower-controlled resource | Obligate metabolic coupling to lattice |
| Metal profile matching | Metallosilazane enzymes evolved in this fracture network's metal chemistry | Chelation badge compatibility (fourth speciation axis) |
| Signal exposure | Bathed in deep-rock system's electrical/EM leakage through conductive lattice | Signal tolerance → signal response → signal integration |

The evolutionary distance from "pool organism at tower base" to "tower symbiote" is a gentle slope of incremental adaptations. Compare: an organism from a generic silicate pool, wind-dispersed to a foreign tower, faces novel surface chemistry, no resource dependency to leverage, mismatched metal profile, and unfamiliar signals — a cliff, not a slope.

**The tower doesn't recruit symbiotes. It manufactures them** by controlling the evolutionary environment from genesis onward. The golden rule: that which controls the resources, makes the rules.

#### Genesis Probability and the Fermi Answer

The genesis environment is: **thousands of monadnock sites along the ~62,000 km terminator flexure zone**, each with hundreds of micro-pools, each running for thousands to millions of years with the full force-multiplier stack. Site count: ~10³–10⁴ simultaneously active favorable sites. Window: ~1–3 Gyr (bounded early by atmospheric stabilization, late by SiH₄ decline).

The genesis bar is low: a self-replicating autocatalytic cycle in a supported environment, not an autonomous organism. The proto-tower provides energy, materials, shelter, and concentration. The genesis product can be far simpler than it would need to be in an unsupported environment.

Pool genesis only needs to succeed **once**. After that, mobile life spreads by wind to all towers (§7.6).

**Void genesis (→ towers) is the expected outcome of any suitable planet's chemistry.** Deep-rock colonies, SiC lattice, surface outcrops — the physics practically demands it on any tidally locked super-Earth with reducing atmosphere and SiH₄. **Pool genesis (→ mobile life) is the rare conjunction**: monadnock + active fracture venting + terminator ammonia + successful coacervation. Most tower-bearing planets never produce mobile life. The universe may be full of silent, growing lattice — towers with no one to walk between them.

### 2.6 Proto-Tower Construction: The Geyser-Cone Mechanism

**[NEW IN V2.4]** The proto-tower is not merely the passive surface expression of a deep-rock system — it is actively **built** by a geyser mechanism at the pool floor.

#### The Geyser Cycle

When the deep-rock reaction front reaches the pool floor via a fracture, it opens a vent into liquid ammonia. The vent gas (SiH₄ + H₂ + CH₄, superheated by geothermal + exothermic reaction heat) enters the pool. At the throat zone where gas meets liquid, PCS deposits rapidly (gas-phase catalytic chemistry, high SiH₄ concentration). The throat narrows, seals with a PCS membrane, back-pressure builds, and the membrane fractures — ejecting a burst of PCS debris + gas + ammonia into the pool. The geyser cycle repeats as the throat reseals.

#### Volcanic Cone Construction

Ejecta deposits in a roughly circular ring around the vent (radial debris field in liquid ammonia). Heavier/denser fragments land closer; finer/more porous fragments travel farther (natural size sorting). The vent area stays clear — each burst scours it.

The inner ring (closest to vent, highest dissolved SiH₄ flux) cements first: catalytically active fragments weld at contact necks via liquid-phase PCS/silazane deposition. Successive geyser cycles deposit new rings on top. The cemented inner structure grows upward through the pool as a **volcanic cone** — miniature cinder-cone morphology, vent channel through the center.

When the cone breaches the pool surface:
- **Atmospheric SiH₄ access** (0.3%, ~10,000× faster than dissolved)
- **Lightning target** (tallest conductive object)
- First strike ceramifies tip (PCS → N:SiC)
- Positive feedback: conductive tip attracts more strikes → ceramification propagates downward → PCS gap forms between lightning front (top-down) and geothermal front (bottom-up)

**The geyser builds the proto-tower. Lightning ceramifies it. The PCS gap forces lateral root expansion.** The seven force multipliers (§2.5) are all explained by this single construction mechanism.

#### The Goldilocks Ring

At intermediate radial distance from the vent, a genesis-favorable zone exists:

| Parameter | Near vent | Goldilocks ring | Far pool |
|---|---|---|---|
| SiH₄ concentration | High (direct gas stream) | Moderate (dissolved, radial transport) | Low (dilute) |
| Cementing rate | Fast (hours) | Slow (days–weeks in liquid phase) | Negligible |
| Fragment size | Coarse (settles fast) | Fine (high surface/volume ratio) | Colloidal (permanent suspension) |
| Geyser disturbance | Violent (scouring) | Periodic agitation | Minimal |
| Genesis chemistry | Too fast, too hot | **Active** | Too dilute |

The PCS fragments are catalytically active (embedded metal nanoparticles from deep-rock chemistry). In liquid ammonia, fragment surfaces undergo aminolysis (Si-H + NH₃ → Si-NH₂ + H₂), creating silazane-functional surfaces. Dissolved metals (leached from fragments as ammine complexes) and building materials (delivered by vent fluid) provide the chemical toolkit for prebiotic chemistry.

The pool has dynamic stratigraphy:

| Zone | State | Genesis role |
|---|---|---|
| Liquid column | Turbid suspension (fine fragments, colloidal metals, dissolved precursors) | Maximum surface area, homogeneous catalysis |
| Bed surface | Recently settled, loose, resuspendable by next burst | Heterogeneous surfaces, sheltered crevices |
| Shallow bed | Partially cemented, pore water trapped | Micro-reactors with distinct chemistry |
| Deep bed | Fully welded | Slow-release reagent reservoir (leaches metals into pool) |

Each geyser cycle is a nutrient pulse. Between pulses, the cemented bed slowly releases metals. Genesis happens in the **liquid phase** on and between fragments — not inside solid material.

#### Cone-Wall Dimorphism

**[PROPOSED]** The volcanic cone creates two sharply distinct ecological niches separated by a physical barrier:

**Inside the cone (sealed pool):** SiH₄ supply cut off when cone growth seals the vent. Dissolved stock depletes as organisms consume it. Rich in dissolved metals and building materials (geyser legacy). Liquid ammonia environment, sheltered, resource-declining. Selective pressure: efficiency, small size, merger for resource sharing, liquid-phase survival.

**Outside the cone (atmospheric surface):** Abundant atmospheric SiH₄ (0.3%, continuous). Metal-poor (no vent supply — rain-deposited only). Solid SiC/PCS surface exposed to wind, weather, lightning. Selective pressure: surface attachment, structural integrity, atmospheric gas exchange.

The cone rim is a **selective filter** for the lineage fork:

- **Amphiphile-membrane organisms** survive the rim crossing: membrane retains interior fluid on solid surface in atmosphere → colonize cone exterior → atmospheric SiH₄ → surface-dwellers → **sexual lineage**
- **Coacervate organisms** are trapped in the pool: liquid-phase entities that cannot maintain coherence outside solvent → depleting resources → efficiency selection, merger capability, flexibility → **amorph lineage**

When lightning ceramifies the chimney tip, the cone exterior becomes the first **tower surface**. Membrane organisms already living there are the first **tower symbiotes** — pre-adapted for surface life on conductive SiC before the tower even exists as such.

**Status: DOWNGRADED.** If pool genesis predates tower arrival at a given pool (§2.7 independent genesis model), the cone is a bulldozer that displaces existing protolife, not a nursery. Cone may impose spatial selection on already-forked lineages during displacement, but is not the cause of the fork. The chemical fork (coacervation vs. amphiphile assembly, §4.3) operates in open pools independent of cone geometry.

### 2.7 Revised Genesis Model: Independent Pool Genesis + Tower as Evolutionary Engine

**[NEW — Feb 2026 follow-up session]**

The geyser-cone mechanism (§2.6) fills fracture-connected pools in **years to decades** (catalytic surface growth ~1.5 mm/yr + ejecta accumulation + contact welding). Pool genesis requires **My-scale**. Therefore **genesis cannot occur in fracture-connected pools**. The proto-tower is not a genesis reactor — it fills its own pools too fast.

#### Independent Pool Genesis

Pool genesis and void genesis are **independent events** on mostly independent variables. If pool genesis is possible at all, it does not require tight coupling to the deep-rock fracture system. Pool genesis requires:

- Stable terminator ammonia pool (rain-fed, non-connected to fracture network)
- Atmospheric SiH₄ (0.3%, dissolved at pool surface)
- Lightning (continuous at terminator — Miller-Urey products)
- Some metal source (rock weathering, rain-deposited particulate, tower ejecta)
- Sufficient time (My-scale)

Tower proximity provides advantages (lightning rod concentration, nutrient rain from ejecta) but is not required. Many stable pools exist along the 62,000 km terminator independent of fracture networks.

#### Tower as Evolutionary Engine

Void genesis (→ towers) inadvertently drives pool genesis forward via **catalytic ejecta**:

**Chronic nutrient rain (continuous, beneficial):** Fine PCS dust from geyser ejecta, wind-transported across the terminator, settles in all pools. Small fragments (10–100 μm) have few metal nanoparticles, high surface-to-volume ratio → passivate fast (days to weeks as metals leach into ammonia as ammine complexes). These are **micronutrient capsules** — timed-release metal delivery to every pool on the terminator.

**Punctuated disturbance (stochastic, drives evolution):** Rare critical-mass fragments (larger, with enough metal centers for sustained catalytic activity) reach distant pools. These compete with protolife for dissolved SiH₄, deposit PCS, locally disrupt pool chemistry. Pool fills → protolife displaced to margins → forced out → most die → survivors colonize adjacent pools. Classic punctuated equilibrium.

**Size-dependent migration is the filter:** Smallest fragments travel farthest, passivate fastest, pose least threat (nutrient). Largest fragments stay near cone (tower construction). Critical-mass fragments travel intermediate distances at intermediate frequency (disturbance). The disturbance tempo is tunable — it depends on geological variables (geyser energy, fracture density, pool spacing) that vary naturally along the terminator.

**The two genesis pathways are synergistic:** Towers build structure. Pool genesis builds life. Tower byproducts (catalytic ejecta) feed and drive pool life. Without towers: no disturbance regime, protolife stagnates. Without stable pools: disturbance has nothing to act on.

#### Chelation Origin

Catalytic fragments in genesis pools are both **threat** (compete for SiH₄) and **resource** (concentrated biometals in nanoparticle form). Silazane chemistry naturally coordinates transition metals via nitrogen lone-pair donation. Evolutionary sequence:

1. Coacervate contacts fragment surface → non-specific metal uptake (free, thermodynamic)
2. Selection for better metal extraction → proto-chelation enzymes
3. Chelation-capable organisms passivate fragments on contact → neutralize threat + harvest metals
4. Fragment rain becomes continuous nutrient delivery for chelation-capable protolife
5. Later exaptation: chelation aimed at other organisms' metalloenzymes → immune **kill mode**
6. Later refinement: calibrated chelation → **toll mode** → symbiote authentication

Chelation evolves as **metal-mining**, not immune defense. The foundational biological metal economy originates from the catalytic rain.

#### Preadaptation via Selection History

Organisms in tower-active terminator zones accumulate tower-contact experience across generations. Repeated displacement by catalytic fragments + chronic exposure to tower chemistry → SiC-surface familiarity, metal-profile compatibility, signal exposure tolerance. Preadaptation is **selection history**, not birthright. The tower doesn't manufacture symbiotes — tower byproducts create the selection regime that produces organisms pre-adapted for eventual symbiosis.

#### The One-Way Door

Pre-biotic volcanic SiC (~9 Tg/yr, ~0.08% of conveyor particulate) already erodes silicate terrain at ~600 mm/Myr. Natural topography is being erased before biology exists. After pool genesis succeeds → mobile organisms → tower colonization → symbiotes → dead-bug plume begins feeding biological SiC into the conveyor. The SiC fraction of the abrasive load jumps dramatically. Peneplain formation accelerates. Genesis conditions are erased — not by a single event, but by the biosphere's own SiC output amplifying an already-ongoing geological process. Abiogenesis is unrepeatable: the monadnock persists, but the surrounding landscape (now mirror-polished) no longer provides the primordial topographic complexity that complemented monadnock shelter during genesis.

---

## 3. POOL GENESIS PATHWAY

Steps parallel void genesis (Chemistry Hub §3.5, §8, §9; bible §4.8). Only pool-specific differences detailed here.

### 3.1 Building Block Delivery

✓ Lightning at the air-liquid interface. Same products as atmospheric plasma CVD (Chemistry Hub §9). Products form AT the surface — the pool's equivalent of the void wall. Continuous delivery; no accumulation bottleneck.

### 3.2 Metallosilazane Formation in Solution

✓ Dissolved silazane fragments coordinate dissolved metals via nitrogen lone-pair donation:

```
H₃Si-NH-SiH₃ + [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺ → [Ni(silazane)(NH₃)₄]²⁺ + 2NH₃
```

Silazane chelates displace ammonia ligands (entropic advantage of chelation). Complex formation is orders of magnitude faster in 3D solution (Brownian encounter) than on 2D rock surfaces. All metals available simultaneously.

### 3.3 Autocatalysis Under Dilution Pressure

✓ Same autocatalytic chemistry as void genesis (Chemistry Hub §8): Ni-silazane complexes catalyze Si-N bond formation, producing more silazane, coordinating more metals, closing the cycle.

**Pool-specific constraint:** Products diffuse away. Autocatalytic rate must exceed dilution rate. Weak autocatalysts are diluted to extinction. The pool is a harsher selection environment than the void — what survives is more efficient.

### 3.4 Coacervation — Compartmentalization

✓ **RESOLVED: Polymethylsilazane (PMSz) coacervation. No membrane required.**

Catalytic polymerization produces PMSz, [-Si(CH₃)H-NH-]ₙ, from SiH₄ + NH₃ + CH₃SiH₃:

```
CH₃SiH₃ + NH₃ → CH₃SiH₂-NH₂ + H₂          (aminolysis)
n CH₃SiH₂-NH₂ → [-Si(CH₃)H-NH-]ₙ + (n-1)NH₃  (condensation)
```

Short chains (N < 25): soluble in NH₃, participate in solution chemistry. Long chains (N > 25–100): Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ exceeds critical value, polymer phase-separates from solvent.

**Thermodynamic basis:** Methyl substituents on the polymer backbone are ammoniaphobic (nonpolar in a polar, H-bonding solvent). Low temperature (240K) reduces TΔS_mixing, favoring phase separation. Complex biological copolymers (with polysilane and carbosilane blocks) have higher χ than pure PMSz.

| Parameter | Value | Basis |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| χ (PMSz / NH₃, 240K) | ⚠ 0.6–0.8 | Methyl ammoniaphobicity; low T; copolymer complexity |
| N_critical | ~15–100 | Standard Flory-Huggins (χ-dependent) |
| Droplet polymer fraction (φ) | ~0.7–0.9 | Typical coacervate |
| Droplet density | ~1,000–1,050 kg/m³ | φρ_polymer + (1-φ)ρ_NH₃ |
| Sinks in NH₃ | ✓ Yes | 1,050 >> 660 kg/m³ |
| Merge behavior | Spontaneous coalescence | Thermodynamically favorable |
| Permeability | SiH₄, NH₃, H₂: pass. Catalysts, fragments: retained | Gel mesh size exclusion |

**Coacervation is a phase equilibrium.** Adding more solvent (rain) increases the bulk phase volume but does not dissolve existing droplets. Ammonia rain feeds polymer synthesis (NH₃ is both solvent and reactant), producing more coacervate, not less.

**The coacervate IS the proto-amorph.** The spine's amorph body description — "silane/silazane gel + silazane oil, ~1,050 kg/m³" — describes a coacervate. Density, gel character, merge/split behavior, and sinking in NH₃ are all consistent.

### 3.5 Information and Replication

✓ Same as void genesis (Chemistry Hub §11). Polysilane backbone, quaternary side-chain code, electronic readout, transcriptive copying. The information system evolves identically in both environments because it uses the same polysilane chemistry. No pool-specific modifications needed.

---

## 4. THE LINEAGE FORK

### 4.1 The Parasitic Merge Problem

Coacervate droplets coalesce spontaneously (reduces interfacial free energy). In a productive pool, this enables:

- **Cooperative merge:** share catalysts, exchange library fragments (beneficial)
- **Parasitic merge:** a catalytically inert droplet enters and consumes a productive droplet's contents (lethal)
- **Predatory merge:** a droplet evolves to force merge, strip resources, and leave (weaponized)

Parasitic and predatory merge create selection pressure for boundary hardening. This is a hawk-dove game: cooperative (soft boundary) vs. defensive (hard boundary). Neither strategy dominates universally.

### 4.2 Amphiphile Coat Chemistry

✓ **RESOLVED: Interface adsorption, not vesicle self-assembly.**

Lightning produces amphiphilic oligomers as minority products: molecules with a polar head (amino group, silazane block) and a nonpolar tail (polysilane, carbosilane). These accumulate at the existing coacervate-ammonia interface by simple surface activity.

**This is interface adsorption, not self-assembly.** The coacervate already has a polymer-rich/polymer-poor interface. Even weak amphiphiles preferentially adsorb at existing interfaces. The thermodynamic bar for coating a droplet is far lower than for building a vesicle from nothing — the marginal solvophobic effect in ammonia (weaker H-bond network than water) is sufficient for interface adsorption.

A thin amphiphile coat sterically blocks coalescence: nonpolar tails face outward, preventing polar-surface contact between droplets.

**Evolutionary reinforcement:**

| Stage | Boundary | Merge resistance |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1. Amphiphile monolayer | Soft, thin | Partial — still breachable |
| 2. Carbosilane cross-linking | Harder | Significant — requires force |
| 3. SiC deposition (carbosilane pathway, Chemistry Hub §6) | Ceramic shell | Complete — merge impossible |

### 4.3 Two Lineages from Different Physics

> **Cross-reference:** For detailed structural materials of both lineages (shell composition, joints, internal bracing, variable rigidity), see **Fauna Structural Engineering Hub §2–5**.

```
POOL CHEMISTRY (simultaneous, not sequential)
│
├── PMSz coacervation (bulk process, spontaneous)
│   ├─ Flexible gel-liquid boundary
│   ├─ Merge/split by coalescence/fragmentation
│   ├─ Horizontal library transfer via merge
│   └─→ AMORPH LINEAGE
│
└── Amphiphile interface adsorption (minority process)
    ├─ Rigid coat → eventually SiC shell
    ├─ No merge; fixed boundary
    ├─ Vertical transfer only → gamete export
    └─→ SEXUAL LINEAGE
```

The fork is physical, not biological. Two different physical processes operating on different subsets of pool chemistry produce two types of compartment from the start.

**Spatial reinforcement (§2.6, DOWNGRADED):** The geyser-built volcanic cone may impose spatial selection on already-forked lineages during displacement events, but is not the cause of the fork. If genesis predates tower arrival at a given pool (§2.7), the lineage fork operates in open pools independent of cone geometry. The cone is a bulldozer, not a nursery.

**Mapping to the three-tier architecture (spine):** Early-stage coacervate droplets — small, no body plan, catalytic, merge/divide — are the **microbial tier**. The amorph lineage scales up to **megafauna** after the pool-to-land transition (§6). The sexual lineage becomes the **middle kingdom** after tower colonization (§7–8).

---

## 5. ENERGY BUDGET AND SIZE CONSTRAINTS

✓ **RESOLVED: Diffusion-limited SiH₄ delivery constrains pool organism size.**

Steady-state SiH₄ flux to a spherical organism in liquid NH₃:

```
J = 4πRD[SiH₄]_bulk

D(SiH₄ in liquid NH₃) ≈ 10⁻⁹ m²/s
[SiH₄]_bulk ≈ 0.1 mol/m³
Energy: 34.3 kJ/mol (primary metabolism)
```

| Diameter | Specific power (W/kg) | Assessment |
|----------|----------------------|------------|
| 10 μm | ~40 | ✓ Easily viable |
| 100 μm | ~0.4 | ✓ Viable, slow-metabolizing |
| 1 mm | ~0.004 | ⚠ Marginal |
| 1 cm | ~0.00004 | ✗ Impossible without supplemental energy |

Square-cube law: volume scales as R³, flux as R. Specific power drops as 1/R².

**Consequences:**

- Pool organisms are inherently **small** (≤100 μm range for free-living).
- The middle kingdom is insect-scale because it descends from small pool organisms (spine: "mm to low-cm," but the cm end requires lattice energy supplement).
- Amorphs become megafauna only **after** the pool-to-land transition unlocks atmospheric (gas-phase) SiH₄ intake, where diffusion is ~10,000× faster than in liquid.

## 6. POOL-TO-LAND TRANSITION

### 6.1 At the Terminator: Trivial

✓ The terminator atmosphere is saturated with NH₃ (condensation line = terminator at 240K). A coacervate droplet stranded at the pool margin by wind-driven currents or shoreline drying loses no ammonia by evaporation — the air is already saturated. No desiccation crisis. The pool-to-land boundary is thermodynamically seamless at the terminator.

### 6.2 Moving Day-ward: Silazane Oil Replacement

Moving day-ward from the terminator, temperature rises, atmosphere becomes undersaturated with NH₃. Gel body loses ammonia by evaporation.

| Day-ward distance | Temperature | NH₃ saturation | Desiccation risk |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| At terminator | 240K | Saturated | None |
| 10–20° day-ward | 245–250K | Slightly under | Low |
| 30–40° (deposition zone) | 250–260K | Under | Significant |
| Substellar | 265K | Strongly under | Severe |

✓ **Solution: replace NH₃ with non-volatile silazane oil.** Low-MW PMSz (N ≈ 5–20) is liquid at 240K and non-volatile. Organisms migrating day-ward progressively replace internal NH₃ with silazane oil, maintaining gel plasticity without evaporative loss.

The spine's amorph body — "silane/silazane gel + silazane oil" — is the endpoint of this transition.

### 6.3 Retained Ancestral Populations

The spine's ammonia-sea amorphs — "smaller, faster-metabolizing, shorter-lived, involuntary broadcast" — are the lineage that **stayed in the pool**. Their properties are direct consequences of pool physics:

| Trait | Chemical basis |
|-------|---------------|
| Smaller | Diffusion-limited energy budget (§5) + petrification repair tax (§2.4) |
| Involuntary broadcast | NH₃ is an ionic conductor; neural signals leak through gel-liquid boundary (Chemistry Hub §10.2) |
| Shorter-lived | Higher surface-to-volume → faster metabolic turnover → faster degradation. Also: chronic petrification damage accumulates (sea H₂O ~50 ppm, K ≈ 10⁵ — every repair costs SiH₄) |
| Faster-metabolizing | Must outrun petrification — maintenance rate floor set by H₂O attack rate |

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Marine glass-shell organisms (diatom analogs): some Middle Kingdom / microbial marine lineages evolved SiO₂ glass armor by controlled surface petrification (letting the sea's H₂O do the work). SiO₂ is at the thermodynamic floor — H₂O can't attack it further. Benefits: zero SiH₄ cost, self-healing, self-passivating. This is a small-organism adaptation; large amorphs shed glass patches rather than integrating them (rigid glass incompatible with reconfigurable body plan). See Chemistry Hub §10.2.

## 7. UNDERSEA TOWER GENESIS

### 7.1 The Setup

The terminator is both a lithospheric flexure zone (fractures) and the ammonia condensation line (seas). These co-locate. Some fractures open onto the sea floor.

A deep-rock system's reaction front propagates upward through a fracture system, reaches a gas-filled void, and does standard void genesis on the void walls (Chemistry Hub §3.5, bible §4.8). If the void opens to the sea floor, the hypercycle encounters liquid ammonia at the gas-liquid interface.

### 7.2 The Metal Bonanza

At the void-sea interface, the hypercycle contacts dissolved metals from the entire basin's hydrothermal budget. The metal-acquisition bottleneck of void genesis is removed.

| Metal acquired | New reaction class enabled | Normal void availability |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Ni | Si-H activation (may already have) | Depends on local rock |
| Fe | Si-C bonds, electron transfer, SiC ceramification | Depends on local rock |
| Co | **Si-Si bond formation (polysilane backbone)** | Rare — often missing |
| Ti | **Long-chain polymerization** | Rare — often missing |

Co and Ti are the critical gains. With Co, the hypercycle synthesizes polysilane (information backbone). With Ti, it polymerizes efficiently. Stages that take geological ages in a metal-poor void happen rapidly when all metals are available.

### 7.3 Reef Morphology

The hypercycle spreads from the void wall onto the sea floor. Growth morphology differs from air towers:

| Air tower | Sea-floor tower |
|-----------|----------------|
| Grows vertical (intercept wind-borne SiH₄) | Grows lateral (maximize sea-floor contact area) |
| Porous column (gas-exchange lung) | Benthic mat / reef |
| Fast SiH₄: convective gas flow | Slower SiH₄: dissolved diffusion + vent gas |

The reef is a spreading, branching mat of N-doped SiC with a living surface layer. Electrically conductive. Capable of signal propagation across the reef.

### 7.4 SiH₄ Capture and Forced Symbiosis

The growing reef consumes vent SiH₄ before it reaches the open sea. Vent exhaust transitions from SiH₄ (energy-rich) to H₂ (metabolically inert — no electron acceptor available in reducing atmosphere). The sea floor loses its energy subsidy.

**Transition is gradual** (reef growth over geological time):

| Reef maturity | Vent SiH₄ reaching sea | Sea-floor ecology |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Early | ~90% | Free-living community unaffected |
| Growing | ~50% | Declining free-living productivity; organisms settling on reef |
| Mature | ~5–10% | Free-living vent community collapsed; survivors on reef |

The reef does not recruit. It **starves the neighborhood** and offers the only alternative: electrical energy via the conductive lattice. Organisms that can tap the lattice survive; others leave or die.

### 7.5 Emergence

The reef spreads laterally and — in shallowing margins — vertically. When the upper surface breaks the air-liquid interface:

- SiH₄ delivery: dissolved diffusion → atmospheric convection (~10,000× faster)
- Wind: piezoelectric energy available
- Starlight: photovoltaic energy available
- Lattice lung: pores drain of ammonia, gas exchange activates

Above the waterline, the reef grows **new** lattice with pore geometry optimized for gas exchange (the submerged lattice, grown for liquid-phase operation, remains liquid-filled or poorly drained). Vertical growth becomes favorable in the aerial zone. The emergent reef carries its aquatic symbiotes above the waterline as the aerial lattice layer thickens.

**The sea-floor tower is one cradle of symbiosis.** The proto-tower-base pool (§2.5) provides the same metal bonanza and vent SiH₄ advantages without the sea's 50 ppm H₂O liability, and adds lightning concentration and atmospheric SiH₄ access. Both pathways operate; the pool-base scenario may be primary for initial genesis, with the undersea scenario as a parallel or later pathway. Wind dispersal (§7.6) is the subsequent diaspora mechanism.

### 7.6 Wind Dispersal to Air-Born Towers

✓ Small hard-shelled organisms (sexual lineage) are wind-transportable: dynamic pressure 370 Pa at 9.5 m/s in 8.2 kg/m³ air. A 100 μm organism is aerosol.

Wind carries organisms from pool surfaces and emergent reef crests to day-side air-born towers. Pre-adaptations for symbiosis: SiH₄ metabolism, SiC deposition, hard shell for fixed lattice position.

Sea-floor contact is the **origin** of symbiosis. Wind is the **dispersal** mechanism. Both operate; origin precedes dispersal.

## 8. SYMBIOTE ELECTRICAL COUPLING

✓ **RESOLVED: Schottky/ohmic junction at metal-semiconductor interface.**

The tower lattice is N-doped SiC (n-type semiconductor). A symbiote's metallosilazane enzymes contain transition metal centers that form metal-semiconductor contacts with the lattice surface.

| Metal center | Work function (eV) | Contact with n-SiC | Energy extraction quality |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Ni | 5.15 | Rectifying (Schottky) | Moderate — current flows one way |
| Fe | 4.5 | Borderline | Moderate |
| Ti | 4.33 | **Near-ohmic** | **Best** — low resistance, bidirectional |

✓ Titanium is the industrial standard for ohmic contacts to SiC. The qualitative ranking (Ti best, then Fe, then Ni) depends on relative work function ordering, which is set by electron configuration and holds regardless of whether the metal is elemental or scaffold-bound. Exact junction voltages will differ from bulk-metal values, but the selection pressure is directional: organisms with more Ti at the contact surface extract energy more efficiently.

**Selection consequence:** Symbiotes with Ti-enriched surface metallurgy are favored. Biology converges on the same contact chemistry the semiconductor industry uses.

| Pool energy budget | ✓ | Diffusion-limited. Viable ≤100 μm. Marginal at 1 mm. Impossible above 1 cm. |
| Pool-to-land transition | ✓ | Trivial at terminator (saturated NH₃). Day-ward: silazane oil replaces NH₃. |
| Undersea tower genesis | ✓ | Reef morphology. Metal bonanza. SiH₄ capture → H₂ exhaust → forced symbiosis. |
| H₂ waste in pool | ✓ | Metabolically inert. No electron acceptor in reducing atmosphere. |
| Symbiote electrical coupling | ✓ | Schottky/ohmic junction. Ti surface enzymes optimal. |
| Ammonia-sea population traits | ✓ | Small (diffusion + petrification tax), involuntary broadcast (ionic leakage), shorter-lived (chronic H₂O damage), ancestral (never left pool). |
| H₂O at genesis sites | ✓ | Fresh terminator pools <1 ppm H₂O (distillation shield). Void genesis anhydrous (reducing buffer). Sea hostile (~50 ppm) but not a genesis site. Pool-to-sea = anti-petrification bottleneck. |
| Marine glass-shell organisms | ✓ | SiO₂ diatom analogs. Controlled surface petrification → self-passivating armor. Zero SiH₄ cost. Middle Kingdom / microbial adaptation. |
| Proto-tower genesis reactor | ✓ | Not merely shelter — seven force multipliers (vent SiH₄, metals, lightning rod, warm fluids, semiconductor substrate, flow-through hydrology, micro-pool multiplication). Best of both pool and undersea genesis environments. |
| Preadaptation gradient | ✓ | Organisms born in tower's resource shadow pre-adapted for symbiosis: SiC contact → junction, vent dependency → coupling, metal match → chelation, signal exposure → tolerance. Tower manufactures its own symbiotes. |
| Pre-biotic volcanic SiC | ✓ | ~9 Tg/yr (~0.08% of conveyor). Differential erosion ratio ~100,000:1 (SiC vs silicate). Monadnock survives >1 Gyr without symbiote support. Mirror-polish is post-biotic; pre-biotic surfaces are smooth but not polished. |
| Genesis probability | ✓ | ~10³–10⁴ monadnock sites, ~1–3 Gyr window, lowered genesis bar (supported environment). Only needs to succeed once. Void genesis (towers) expected on any suitable planet; pool genesis (mobile life) is the rare conjunction — Fermi answer. |
| Proto-tower construction | ✓ | Geyser-built volcanic cone. Throat seals → back-pressure → burst → ring ejecta → cemented cone → breaches surface → lightning rod → ceramifies → proto-tower. |
| Goldilocks ring | ✓ | Catalytically active PCS fragments at intermediate distance from vent. Slow cementing in liquid phase. Genesis chemistry on fragment surfaces. Dynamic stratigraphy. |
| Cone-wall dimorphism | ⚠ DOWNGRADED | Secondary effect at most. If genesis predates tower, cone is bulldozer not nursery. May reinforce but does not cause lineage fork. |
| Deep-rock reaction front | ✓ | No active tail. Front-only model. Behind front: H₂-permeable, SiH₄-opaque (molecular sieve). Exothermic self-fracturing. Chimney self-selection of surface-connected fractures. |
| Independent pool genesis | ✓ | Pool genesis does not require tight coupling to void/crack genesis. Requires stable terminator pools + atmospheric SiH₄ + lightning + metals + My-scale time. Tower proximity helps but is not required. |
| Tower as evolutionary engine | ✓ | Void genesis inadvertently drives pool genesis via catalytic ejecta: chronic nutrient rain (fine fragments, metal delivery) + punctuated disturbance (critical-mass fragments, displacement events). Synergistic, not coupled. |
| Fracture-connected pool filling | ✓ | Geyser-cone + catalytic exterior growth + ejecta welding fills connected pools in years to decades. Genesis (My-scale) CANNOT occur in connected pools. |
| Chelation origin | ✓ | Evolves as metal-mining from catalytic PCS fragments, not immune defense. Silazane N lone-pair coordinates metals spontaneously. Later exapted to kill mode → toll mode → symbiote authentication. |
| Preadaptation via selection history | ✓ | Repeated tower-contact across generations via catalytic rain + displacement. Selection history, not birthright. Tower doesn't manufacture symbiotes; tower byproducts create selection regime. |

## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS

### Resolved This Session

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Gamete surface recognition | ✓ Exaptation of library end-cap addressing system (Chemistry Hub §11.2). Cyclic trisilazane caps with complementary binding pockets define two gamete types. Specificity = cap-pair divergence (4⁶ = 4,096 possible patterns). No new molecular machinery needed. |
| Reef-to-column transition | ✓ Reef with columns. Broad submerged base; multiple vertical growths from aerial surface. Morphologically distinct from air-born towers (point-nucleated columns). SiC compressive strength (~3,900 MPa) easily supports columns on reef base in 1.82g. |

### Constrained but Open

| Question | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Shore populations | ⚠ Plausible | Partially coated coacervates at pool-reef boundary. Dual-interface body: soft gel regions (amorph EM-compatible) + SiC-patched regions (lattice-contactable). Follows from boundary environment but ionic → semiconductor signal transduction not chemically grounded. |
| Reef-tower network wars | ⚠ Constrained | Reef-tower signal chemistry likely MORE different from air-born towers (pool-derived metal diversity → different dopant profiles). Mismatch is real; consequences are a narrative choice (harder to assimilate, or more dangerous if assimilated). |

### Low Priority (Number Refinements)

| Question | Priority | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Henry's law constant for SiH₄ in liquid NH₃ at 240K | Low | Estimated ~0.1 mM. Affects energy budget quantitatively, not qualitatively. |
| Exact Flory-Huggins χ for PMSz/NH₃ | Low | Range 0.6–0.8 sufficient. Exact value shifts N_crit but model is robust across range. |
| Pool genesis vs void genesis timing | Low | Both run in parallel at terminator. No required sequence except undersea tower scenario (void → reef → pool contact). |
