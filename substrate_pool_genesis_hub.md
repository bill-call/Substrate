# SUBSTRATE — POOL GENESIS HUB

**v2.3 — February 2026**

**Load with:** Spine (required). Silicon Chemistry Hub §14 (recommended, for void genesis comparison).

Pool genesis is the liquid-phase origin of mobile, replicating life. It complements void genesis (Chemistry Hub §14), which produces surface-attached, non-replicating towers. Both pathways operate at the terminator; divergence is phase, not geography. This hub covers ammonia-pool abiogenesis, compartmentalization, the amorph/sexual lineage fork, energy constraints, the pool-to-land transition, and the undersea tower scenario that bootstraps symbiosis.

---

## 1. POOL vs VOID — THE PHASE DIFFERENCE

Both genesis environments share: terminator location, lightning access, atmospheric feedstocks (SiH₄ 0.3%, NH₃ 12.5%, CH₄ 10%), and geothermal input. Divergence is entirely in reaction medium.

| Parameter | Void genesis (→ towers) | Pool genesis (→ mobile life) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Reaction medium | Mineral surface in gas-filled crack | Liquid NH₃ (~660 kg/m³, 240K) |
| Concentration mechanism | Surface accumulation (2D, no dilution) | Phase separation / coacervation (3D) |
| Metal delivery | Leached from local wall rock (slow, parochial) | Dissolved as ammine complexes (fast, diverse) |
| Lightning access | Indirect (products rain down) | Direct (strikes pool surface) |
| Dilution problem | None | Critical — drives compartmentalization |
| Compartmentalization | Unnecessary (surface-attached) | Required (coacervation) |
| Product | Non-replicating lattice organism | Replicating mobile organisms (two lineages) |

See Chemistry Hub §14 for the complete void genesis pathway. This document covers pool genesis only, noting parallels where relevant.

## 2. POOL ENVIRONMENT

### 2.1 Solvent

| Property | Liquid NH₃ at 8 bar, 240K | Water at 1 bar, 293K (comparison) |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| State | Liquid (boils ~290K at 8 bar) | Liquid |
| Density | ~660–680 kg/m³ | 998 kg/m³ |
| Viscosity | ~0.20 mPa·s | 1.00 mPa·s |
| Dielectric constant | ~25 | 80 |
| H-bond strength | N-H···N ≈ 13 kJ/mol | O-H···O ≈ 20 kJ/mol |
| Surface tension | ~23 mN/m | 72 mN/m |
| Autoprotolysis | 2NH₃ ⇌ NH₄⁺ + NH₂⁻ | 2H₂O ⇌ H₃O⁺ + OH⁻ |

✓ NH₃ does not attack Si-Si bonds. It forms Si-N bonds (silazane) — the biological matrix. NH₃ is the biologically compatible solvent; H₂O is the poison (Chemistry Hub §1).

### 2.2 Dissolved Resources

**Metals:** Volcanic basin rock leaches into ammonia as stable ammine complexes:

| Metal | Complex | Source | Biological role (Chemistry Hub §8) |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Nickel | [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺ | Pentlandite, metal sulfides | Si-H/C-H activation, silane metabolism |
| Iron | [Fe(NH₃)₆]²⁺ | Troilite, native iron | Electron transfer, SiC ceramification |
| Cobalt | [Co(NH₃)₆]²⁺/³⁺ | Metal arsenides, sulfides | Si-Si bond formation (polysilane backbone) |
| Titanium | Ti(NH₂)₄ / polymeric Ti-NH species | Ilmenite, rutile | Polymerization, chain extension |

All four biometals available simultaneously in solution. Void genesis gets only what local rock mineralogy provides.

**Silane:** SiH₄ dissolves from the atmosphere at the air-liquid interface. Henry's law equilibrium at 0.024 bar partial pressure. Estimated dissolved concentration: ⚠ ~0.1 mM. Biology consumes dissolved SiH₄ continuously, maintaining undersaturation — the sea is a net silane **sink**, pulling atmospheric SiH₄ inward.

**Lightning products:** Plasma CVD at the air-liquid interface produces aminosilanes (H₂N-SiH₃), methylsilanes (CH₃SiH₃), silazane fragments, and carbosilane fragments. Polar products dissolve immediately; nonpolar products accumulate as surface film. See Chemistry Hub §9.

### 2.3 Hydrothermal Vents

Where fractures intersect the sea floor, vent fluids deliver: concentrated metals (basin-wide hydrothermal budget), geothermal SiH₄ (locally elevated concentration, bypassing the air-liquid dissolution bottleneck), and warm fluid (+5–20K). Vents create metal-rich hotspots that accelerate pool chemistry but are not required for pool genesis.

### 2.4 H₂O Contamination and Genesis Viability

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Silazane hydrolysis (Si-NH-Si + H₂O → Si-O-Si + NH₃) has K ≈ 1.6 × 10⁵ at 240K (Geology Hub §6). Pre-biotic silazane polymers — with no metabolic repair machinery — cannot survive in environments with >6 ppm H₂O. Does trace H₂O kill pool genesis?

**No. The distillation shield protects terminator pools.**

At 240K, NH₃ vapor pressure >> H₂O vapor pressure (~10,000:1). Rain and condensation carry only atmospheric H₂O, which is further suppressed by SiH₄ scavenging pre-crisis. Fresh terminator pools: estimated <1 ppm H₂O.

| Environment | H₂O (ppm) | % silazane hydrolyzed at eq. | Genesis? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh terminator pool | <1 | <14% | ✓ Viable |
| Aged pool (some vent contact) | 1–10 | 14–62% | ⚠ Marginal |
| Open sea (hydrothermal accumulation) | ~50 | ~89% | ✗ Hostile |
| Vent-adjacent sea floor | <5 | <45% | ✓ Locally protected |

The sea concentrates H₂O from hydrothermal injection, meteoritic delivery, and photochemistry over geological time. Fresh pools don't accumulate these non-atmospheric sources.

**Consequences:**
- Pool genesis proceeds in H₂O-poor terminator pools — the distillation shield is sufficient.
- The **pool-to-sea transition** (§6) is the evolutionary bottleneck where anti-petrification defenses must evolve. Every marine lineage passed through this filter.
- Pool-to-land is easier than pool-to-sea from a petrification standpoint: terminator land air has comparable H₂O to the birth pool, while the sea has 50–100× more.
- Vent microenvironments on the sea floor are locally H₂O-depleted (vent fluids passed through reducing mantle, same chemistry that protects void genesis — Chemistry Hub §10.3). This supports undersea reef genesis (§7) in an otherwise hostile sea.

See Chemistry Hub §10.3 for the full thermodynamic analysis. See Geology Hub §6 for petrification kinetics and biological defense.

### 2.5 Pool Persistence: The Proto-Tower Shelter

**[NEW IN V2.4]** An ammonia pool on an open surface is a sediment trap. Atmospheric particulate (volcanic fines, and later SiC from the dead-bug plume) falls out wherever wind meets liquid (wave-induced turbulence reduces wind carrying capacity). All particulate sinks in ammonia (solids: 2500–3200 kg/m³ vs ammonia: 660 kg/m³). Without outflow, the pool fills with sediment and dies. This is the fundamental geomorphological constraint on pool genesis: **the pool must persist long enough for abiogenesis**.

The solution is the **proto-tower**. Before surface biology exists, the deep-rock colony already deposits SiC lattice at the surface (void genesis pathway, Chemistry Hub §14). This lattice structure is a mountain — a persistent roughness element made of SiC (Mohs 9.5), highly resistant to pre-biotic abrasion (which uses only silicate particulate, Mohs 6-7). The proto-tower provides:

1. **Wind shelter.** Lee-side wind shadow where ammonia rain pools without being evaporated or blown away.
2. **Gravitational gradient.** Topographic relief around the mountain base creates drainage — the pool is a flow-through system, not a closed basin. Outflow carries fine suspended sediment, extending pool lifetime.
3. **Roughness for ammonia retention.** Irregular topography at the tower base (root structures, scour features, rubble) creates many small depressions that hold ammonia.

The genesis environment is specifically: **millions of small ammonia pools in the broken topography around proto-tower bases, at the terminator**. Not one large sea. Each pool is an independent abiogenesis experiment with slightly different conditions (temperature, mineral exposure, SiH₄ flux, catalytic metal concentration). Highly parallel.

**Temporal bootstrap:** Pool genesis must occur while primordial topography (impact basins, crustal roughness) still supplements proto-tower shelter. Once the surface ecosystem establishes and the dead-bug plume begins feeding SiC into the atmospheric conveyor, accelerated peneplain formation erases natural basins. Tower-maintained basins replace them — but this requires the symbiosis to already be established. The ecosystem pulls up the ladder behind it. Surface abiogenesis is a **one-way door**: unrepeatable once the SiC-polished peneplain replaces primordial topography.

Pool genesis is chemically independent of the proto-tower — the tower provides geomorphological shelter only, not chemical input. The undersea tower scenario (§7) is a separate, later pathway where pool organisms colonize the adjacent tower surface.

## 3. POOL GENESIS PATHWAY

Steps parallel void genesis (Chemistry Hub §14.1–14.8). Only pool-specific differences detailed here.

### 3.1 Building Block Delivery

✓ Lightning at the air-liquid interface. Same products as atmospheric plasma CVD (Chemistry Hub §9). Products form AT the surface — the pool's equivalent of the void wall. Continuous delivery; no accumulation bottleneck.

### 3.2 Metallosilazane Formation in Solution

✓ Dissolved silazane fragments coordinate dissolved metals via nitrogen lone-pair donation:

```
H₃Si-NH-SiH₃ + [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺ → [Ni(silazane)(NH₃)₄]²⁺ + 2NH₃
```

Silazane chelates displace ammonia ligands (entropic advantage of chelation). Complex formation is orders of magnitude faster in 3D solution (Brownian encounter) than on 2D rock surfaces. All metals available simultaneously.

### 3.3 Autocatalysis Under Dilution Pressure

✓ Same autocatalytic chemistry as void genesis (Chemistry Hub §14.4–14.5): Ni-silazane complexes catalyze Si-N bond formation, producing more silazane, coordinating more metals, closing the cycle.

**Pool-specific constraint:** Products diffuse away. Autocatalytic rate must exceed dilution rate. Weak autocatalysts are diluted to extinction. The pool is a harsher selection environment than the void — what survives is more efficient.

### 3.4 Coacervation — Compartmentalization

✓ **RESOLVED: Polymethylsilazane (PMSz) coacervation. No membrane required.**

Catalytic polymerization produces PMSz, [-Si(CH₃)H-NH-]ₙ, from SiH₄ + NH₃ + CH₃SiH₃:

```
CH₃SiH₃ + NH₃ → CH₃SiH₂-NH₂ + H₂          (aminolysis)
n CH₃SiH₂-NH₂ → [-Si(CH₃)H-NH-]ₙ + (n-1)NH₃  (condensation)
```

Short chains (N < 25): soluble in NH₃, participate in solution chemistry. Long chains (N > 25–100): Flory-Huggins interaction parameter χ exceeds critical value, polymer phase-separates from solvent.

**Thermodynamic basis:** Methyl substituents on the polymer backbone are ammoniaphobic (nonpolar in a polar, H-bonding solvent). Low temperature (240K) reduces TΔS_mixing, favoring phase separation. Complex biological copolymers (with polysilane and carbosilane blocks) have higher χ than pure PMSz.

| Parameter | Value | Basis |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| χ (PMSz / NH₃, 240K) | ⚠ 0.6–0.8 | Methyl ammoniaphobicity; low T; copolymer complexity |
| N_critical | ~15–100 | Standard Flory-Huggins (χ-dependent) |
| Droplet polymer fraction (φ) | ~0.7–0.9 | Typical coacervate |
| Droplet density | ~1,000–1,050 kg/m³ | φρ_polymer + (1-φ)ρ_NH₃ |
| Sinks in NH₃ | ✓ Yes | 1,050 >> 660 kg/m³ |
| Merge behavior | Spontaneous coalescence | Thermodynamically favorable |
| Permeability | SiH₄, NH₃, H₂: pass. Catalysts, fragments: retained | Gel mesh size exclusion |

**Coacervation is a phase equilibrium.** Adding more solvent (rain) increases the bulk phase volume but does not dissolve existing droplets. Ammonia rain feeds polymer synthesis (NH₃ is both solvent and reactant), producing more coacervate, not less.

**The coacervate IS the proto-amorph.** The spine's amorph body description — "silane/silazane gel + silazane oil, ~1,050 kg/m³" — describes a coacervate. Density, gel character, merge/split behavior, and sinking in NH₃ are all consistent.

### 3.5 Information and Replication

✓ Same as void genesis (Chemistry Hub §14.6–14.8). Polysilane backbone, quaternary side-chain code, electronic readout, transcriptive copying. The information system evolves identically in both environments because it uses the same polysilane chemistry. No pool-specific modifications needed.

---

## 4. THE LINEAGE FORK

### 4.1 The Parasitic Merge Problem

Coacervate droplets coalesce spontaneously (reduces interfacial free energy). In a productive pool, this enables:

- **Cooperative merge:** share catalysts, exchange library fragments (beneficial)
- **Parasitic merge:** a catalytically inert droplet enters and consumes a productive droplet's contents (lethal)
- **Predatory merge:** a droplet evolves to force merge, strip resources, and leave (weaponized)

Parasitic and predatory merge create selection pressure for boundary hardening. This is a hawk-dove game: cooperative (soft boundary) vs. defensive (hard boundary). Neither strategy dominates universally.

### 4.2 Amphiphile Coat Chemistry

✓ **RESOLVED: Interface adsorption, not vesicle self-assembly.**

Lightning produces amphiphilic oligomers as minority products: molecules with a polar head (amino group, silazane block) and a nonpolar tail (polysilane, carbosilane). These accumulate at the existing coacervate-ammonia interface by simple surface activity.

**This is interface adsorption, not self-assembly.** The coacervate already has a polymer-rich/polymer-poor interface. Even weak amphiphiles preferentially adsorb at existing interfaces. The thermodynamic bar for coating a droplet is far lower than for building a vesicle from nothing — the marginal solvophobic effect in ammonia (weaker H-bond network than water) is sufficient for interface adsorption.

A thin amphiphile coat sterically blocks coalescence: nonpolar tails face outward, preventing polar-surface contact between droplets.

**Evolutionary reinforcement:**

| Stage | Boundary | Merge resistance |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1. Amphiphile monolayer | Soft, thin | Partial — still breachable |
| 2. Carbosilane cross-linking | Harder | Significant — requires force |
| 3. SiC deposition (carbosilane pathway, Chemistry Hub §6) | Ceramic shell | Complete — merge impossible |

### 4.3 Two Lineages from Different Physics

> **Cross-reference:** For detailed structural materials of both lineages (shell composition, joints, internal bracing, variable rigidity), see **Fauna Structural Engineering Hub §2–5**.

```
POOL CHEMISTRY (simultaneous, not sequential)
│
├── PMSz coacervation (bulk process, spontaneous)
│   ├─ Flexible gel-liquid boundary
│   ├─ Merge/split by coalescence/fragmentation
│   ├─ Horizontal library transfer via merge
│   └─→ AMORPH LINEAGE
│
└── Amphiphile interface adsorption (minority process)
    ├─ Rigid coat → eventually SiC shell
    ├─ No merge; fixed boundary
    ├─ Vertical transfer only → gamete export
    └─→ SEXUAL LINEAGE
```

The fork is physical, not biological. Two different physical processes operating on different subsets of pool chemistry produce two types of compartment from the start.

**Mapping to the three-tier architecture (spine):** Early-stage coacervate droplets — small, no body plan, catalytic, merge/divide — are the **microbial tier**. The amorph lineage scales up to **megafauna** after the pool-to-land transition (§6). The sexual lineage becomes the **middle kingdom** after tower colonization (§7–8).

---

## 5. ENERGY BUDGET AND SIZE CONSTRAINTS

✓ **RESOLVED: Diffusion-limited SiH₄ delivery constrains pool organism size.**

Steady-state SiH₄ flux to a spherical organism in liquid NH₃:

```
J = 4πRD[SiH₄]_bulk

D(SiH₄ in liquid NH₃) ≈ 10⁻⁹ m²/s
[SiH₄]_bulk ≈ 0.1 mol/m³
Energy: 34.3 kJ/mol (primary metabolism)
```

| Diameter | Specific power (W/kg) | Assessment |
|----------|----------------------|------------|
| 10 μm | ~40 | ✓ Easily viable |
| 100 μm | ~0.4 | ✓ Viable, slow-metabolizing |
| 1 mm | ~0.004 | ⚠ Marginal |
| 1 cm | ~0.00004 | ✗ Impossible without supplemental energy |

Square-cube law: volume scales as R³, flux as R. Specific power drops as 1/R².

**Consequences:**

- Pool organisms are inherently **small** (≤100 μm range for free-living).
- The middle kingdom is insect-scale because it descends from small pool organisms (spine: "mm to low-cm," but the cm end requires lattice energy supplement).
- Amorphs become megafauna only **after** the pool-to-land transition unlocks atmospheric (gas-phase) SiH₄ intake, where diffusion is ~10,000× faster than in liquid.

---

## 6. POOL-TO-LAND TRANSITION

### 6.1 At the Terminator: Trivial

✓ The terminator atmosphere is saturated with NH₃ (condensation line = terminator at 240K). A coacervate droplet stranded at the pool margin by wind-driven currents or shoreline drying loses no ammonia by evaporation — the air is already saturated. No desiccation crisis. The pool-to-land boundary is thermodynamically seamless at the terminator.

### 6.2 Moving Day-ward: Silazane Oil Replacement

Moving day-ward from the terminator, temperature rises, atmosphere becomes undersaturated with NH₃. Gel body loses ammonia by evaporation.

| Day-ward distance | Temperature | NH₃ saturation | Desiccation risk |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| At terminator | 240K | Saturated | None |
| 10–20° day-ward | 245–250K | Slightly under | Low |
| 30–40° (deposition zone) | 250–260K | Under | Significant |
| Substellar | 265K | Strongly under | Severe |

✓ **Solution: replace NH₃ with non-volatile silazane oil.** Low-MW PMSz (N ≈ 5–20) is liquid at 240K and non-volatile. Organisms migrating day-ward progressively replace internal NH₃ with silazane oil, maintaining gel plasticity without evaporative loss.

The spine's amorph body — "silane/silazane gel + silazane oil" — is the endpoint of this transition.

### 6.3 Retained Ancestral Populations

The spine's ammonia-sea amorphs — "smaller, faster-metabolizing, shorter-lived, involuntary broadcast" — are the lineage that **stayed in the pool**. Their properties are direct consequences of pool physics:

| Trait | Chemical basis |
|-------|---------------|
| Smaller | Diffusion-limited energy budget (§5) + petrification repair tax (§2.4) |
| Involuntary broadcast | NH₃ is an ionic conductor; neural signals leak through gel-liquid boundary (Chemistry Hub §10.2) |
| Shorter-lived | Higher surface-to-volume → faster metabolic turnover → faster degradation. Also: chronic petrification damage accumulates (sea H₂O ~50 ppm, K ≈ 10⁵ — every repair costs SiH₄) |
| Faster-metabolizing | Must outrun petrification — maintenance rate floor set by H₂O attack rate |

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Marine glass-shell organisms (diatom analogs): some Middle Kingdom / microbial marine lineages evolved SiO₂ glass armor by controlled surface petrification (letting the sea's H₂O do the work). SiO₂ is at the thermodynamic floor — H₂O can't attack it further. Benefits: zero SiH₄ cost, self-healing, self-passivating. This is a small-organism adaptation; large amorphs shed glass patches rather than integrating them (rigid glass incompatible with reconfigurable body plan). See Chemistry Hub §10.2.

---

## 7. UNDERSEA TOWER GENESIS

### 7.1 The Setup

The terminator is both a lithospheric flexure zone (fractures) and the ammonia condensation line (seas). These co-locate. Some fractures open onto the sea floor.

A deep-rock colony's hypercycle propagates upward through a fracture system, reaches a gas-filled void, and does standard void genesis on the void walls (Chemistry Hub §14). If the void opens to the sea floor, the hypercycle encounters liquid ammonia at the gas-liquid interface.

### 7.2 The Metal Bonanza

At the void-sea interface, the hypercycle contacts dissolved metals from the entire basin's hydrothermal budget. The metal-acquisition bottleneck of void genesis is removed.

| Metal acquired | New reaction class enabled | Normal void availability |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Ni | Si-H activation (may already have) | Depends on local rock |
| Fe | Si-C bonds, electron transfer, SiC ceramification | Depends on local rock |
| Co | **Si-Si bond formation (polysilane backbone)** | Rare — often missing |
| Ti | **Long-chain polymerization** | Rare — often missing |

Co and Ti are the critical gains. With Co, the hypercycle synthesizes polysilane (information backbone). With Ti, it polymerizes efficiently. Stages that take geological ages in a metal-poor void happen rapidly when all metals are available.

### 7.3 Reef Morphology

The hypercycle spreads from the void wall onto the sea floor. Growth morphology differs from air towers:

| Air tower | Sea-floor tower |
|-----------|----------------|
| Grows vertical (intercept wind-borne SiH₄) | Grows lateral (maximize sea-floor contact area) |
| Porous column (gas-exchange lung) | Benthic mat / reef |
| Fast SiH₄: convective gas flow | Slower SiH₄: dissolved diffusion + vent gas |

The reef is a spreading, branching mat of N-doped SiC with a living surface layer. Electrically conductive. Capable of signal propagation across the reef.

### 7.4 SiH₄ Capture and Forced Symbiosis

The growing reef consumes vent SiH₄ before it reaches the open sea. Vent exhaust transitions from SiH₄ (energy-rich) to H₂ (metabolically inert — no electron acceptor available in reducing atmosphere). The sea floor loses its energy subsidy.

**Transition is gradual** (reef growth over geological time):

| Reef maturity | Vent SiH₄ reaching sea | Sea-floor ecology |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Early | ~90% | Free-living community unaffected |
| Growing | ~50% | Declining free-living productivity; organisms settling on reef |
| Mature | ~5–10% | Free-living vent community collapsed; survivors on reef |

The reef does not recruit. It **starves the neighborhood** and offers the only alternative: electrical energy via the conductive lattice. Organisms that can tap the lattice survive; others leave or die.

### 7.5 Emergence

The reef spreads laterally and — in shallowing margins — vertically. When the upper surface breaks the air-liquid interface:

- SiH₄ delivery: dissolved diffusion → atmospheric convection (~10,000× faster)
- Wind: piezoelectric energy available
- Starlight: photovoltaic energy available
- Lattice lung: pores drain of ammonia, gas exchange activates

Above the waterline, the reef grows **new** lattice with pore geometry optimized for gas exchange (the submerged lattice, grown for liquid-phase operation, remains liquid-filled or poorly drained). Vertical growth becomes favorable in the aerial zone. The emergent reef carries its aquatic symbiotes above the waterline as the aerial lattice layer thickens.

**The sea-floor tower is the cradle of symbiosis.** Wind dispersal (§7.6) is the subsequent diaspora mechanism.

### 7.6 Wind Dispersal to Air-Born Towers

✓ Small hard-shelled organisms (sexual lineage) are wind-transportable: dynamic pressure 370 Pa at 9.5 m/s in 8.2 kg/m³ air. A 100 μm organism is aerosol.

Wind carries organisms from pool surfaces and emergent reef crests to day-side air-born towers. Pre-adaptations for symbiosis: SiH₄ metabolism, SiC deposition, hard shell for fixed lattice position.

Sea-floor contact is the **origin** of symbiosis. Wind is the **dispersal** mechanism. Both operate; origin precedes dispersal.

---

## 8. SYMBIOTE ELECTRICAL COUPLING

✓ **RESOLVED: Schottky/ohmic junction at metal-semiconductor interface.**

The tower lattice is N-doped SiC (n-type semiconductor). A symbiote's metallosilazane enzymes contain transition metal centers that form metal-semiconductor contacts with the lattice surface.

| Metal center | Work function (eV) | Contact with n-SiC | Energy extraction quality |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Ni | 5.15 | Rectifying (Schottky) | Moderate — current flows one way |
| Fe | 4.5 | Borderline | Moderate |
| Ti | 4.33 | **Near-ohmic** | **Best** — low resistance, bidirectional |

✓ Titanium is the industrial standard for ohmic contacts to SiC. The qualitative ranking (Ti best, then Fe, then Ni) depends on relative work function ordering, which is set by electron configuration and holds regardless of whether the metal is elemental or scaffold-bound. Exact junction voltages will differ from bulk-metal values, but the selection pressure is directional: organisms with more Ti at the contact surface extract energy more efficiently.

**Selection consequence:** Symbiotes with Ti-enriched surface metallurgy are favored. Biology converges on the same contact chemistry the semiconductor industry uses.

## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS

### Resolved This Session

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| Gamete surface recognition | ✓ Exaptation of library end-cap addressing system (Chemistry Hub §11.2). Cyclic trisilazane caps with complementary binding pockets define two gamete types. Specificity = cap-pair divergence (4⁶ = 4,096 possible patterns). No new molecular machinery needed. |
| Reef-to-column transition | ✓ Reef with columns. Broad submerged base; multiple vertical growths from aerial surface. Morphologically distinct from air-born towers (point-nucleated columns). SiC compressive strength (~3,900 MPa) easily supports columns on reef base in 1.82g. |

### Constrained but Open

| Question | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Shore populations | ⚠ Plausible | Partially coated coacervates at pool-reef boundary. Dual-interface body: soft gel regions (amorph EM-compatible) + SiC-patched regions (lattice-contactable). Follows from boundary environment but ionic → semiconductor signal transduction not chemically grounded. |
| Reef-tower network wars | ⚠ Constrained | Reef-tower signal chemistry likely MORE different from air-born towers (pool-derived metal diversity → different dopant profiles). Mismatch is real; consequences are a narrative choice (harder to assimilate, or more dangerous if assimilated). |

### Low Priority (Number Refinements)

| Question | Priority | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Henry's law constant for SiH₄ in liquid NH₃ at 240K | Low | Estimated ~0.1 mM. Affects energy budget quantitatively, not qualitatively. |
| Exact Flory-Huggins χ for PMSz/NH₃ | Low | Range 0.6–0.8 sufficient. Exact value shifts N_crit but model is robust across range. |
| Pool genesis vs void genesis timing | Low | Both run in parallel at terminator. No required sequence except undersea tower scenario (void → reef → pool contact). |
