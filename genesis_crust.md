# The Genesis Crust

## From Voids to Crust: A Correction

Early analysis of subsurface abiogenesis on this planet focused on **genesis voids** — gas-filled cavities in volcanic rock, basketball-sized, held at the ammonia dewpoint by a self-regulating thermal feedback. The original census estimated ~10¹³ such voids in the terminator zone, each a tiny independent reactor. That estimate was not wrong, but it was counting the croutons and missing the soup.

The voids are real. They work. But they are a vanishingly small fraction of the total reactive environment. The overwhelming majority of catalytic abiogenesis occurs not in discrete cavities but in the **fracture network itself** — the cracks, joints, and fissures that permeate the upper crust of the terminator zone. The planet's entire upper crust is a catalytic reactor, and the voids are just the largest pores in its structure.

This chapter traces the reasoning that led from the void model to the crust model, estimates the true scale of the reactive environment, and identifies three nested genesis regimes that operate simultaneously within the fracture network.

## The Planet (Summary)

A tidally locked super-Earth orbiting a red dwarf.

- **Radius:** ~1.5 R_Earth. **Surface gravity:** ~2g. **Surface area:** ~1.15 × 10⁹ km².
- **Atmosphere:** H₂ 78%, CH₄ 12%, NH₃ 5%, N₂ 3%, SiH₄ 0.3%. Surface pressure ~8 bar at the terminator.
- **Terminator surface temperature:** ~270 K. Ammonia is liquid at the surface.
- **Permanent storm front** at the terminator — continuous lightning forging complex silicon-nitrogen-carbon molecules in the atmosphere.
- **Geology:** Mafic/ultramafic crust. Transition metals (Ni, Fe, Co, Ti) ubiquitous. Volcanically active, especially day-side, with geothermal gradients extending well past the terminator.
- **Geothermal silane:** SiH₄ generated at depth (Si + 2H₂ → SiH₄) percolates upward through fracture networks.

## Silatholins

Lightning in the upper atmosphere drives Miller-Urey-type synthesis in the H₂/CH₄/NH₃/SiH₄ mixture, producing a complex zoo of silicon-nitrogen-carbon-hydrogen compounds: methylsilanes, silazane fragments, carbosilane oligomers, amino-functionalized chains, and heavier species that defy clean naming. As a class, these are **silatholins** — by analogy with Carl Sagan's *tholins* (the reddish organic gunk produced by electrical discharge in Titan-like atmospheres), but with silicon backbones and Si–N linkages alongside the carbon-nitrogen chemistry.

Silatholins are nonvolatile, soluble in liquid ammonia, and chemically reactive. They dissolve in ammonia rain and are carried underground, where they become the feedstock for catalytic abiogenesis.

## Why the Void Model Was Too Narrow

The original genesis void model required a gas-filled cavity held precisely at the ammonia dewpoint (240–265 K). This constraint arose from a specific physical picture: ammonia rain trickles down through cracks, evaporates as it enters the warmer void, deposits its silatholin payload as gas-phase molecules that settle by gravity to the catalytic floor, and the catalytic floor is where all the interesting chemistry happens. Gravity sorts: heavy silatholins fall, light H₂ rises, and the floor is the privileged surface.

This picture is elegant but fragile. The 25 K thermal window was the tightest constraint in the census, limiting the viable depth band to a few hundred meters and requiring a precise balance between geothermal heating and evaporative cooling.

Three realizations break the model open.

### 1. Liquid-filled voids work

If the void temperature is below the ammonia dewpoint, the cavity fills with liquid ammonia. The original model treated this as failure (condition 7: "not flooded"). But a liquid-filled void with silane bubbling up from below is a **bubble-column reactor** — one of the most effective configurations in industrial catalysis. The gas-liquid interface on every bubble is highly reactive. The liquid keeps dissolved silatholins in continuous contact with the catalytic walls. H₂, nearly insoluble in liquid ammonia, still bubbles out — the entropy pump still functions.

Ammonia enters from above under hydrostatic pressure and percolates out through the floor and walls. It is not stagnant. Fresh silatholin-bearing rain enters continuously; stale liquid drains continuously. The void is a flow-through system.

The gravity-sorting advantage of the gas-phase model is lost — heavy silatholins don't settle to the floor when they're dissolved in liquid. But a new advantage appears: in a liquid-filled void, **every surface is catalytically active**, not just the floor. Walls, ceiling, crack mouths, irregularities — all of them are in contact with flowing, silatholin-rich liquid.

The thermal window for viable voids expands from 240–265 K (gas-phase dewpoint regime) to roughly **196–320 K** (ammonia freezing point to boiling point at local pressure). A ~25 K window becomes a ~120 K window. The depth band widens by nearly 5×.

### 2. The selective advantage of upward growth survives

In the gas-phase void, catalytic structures on the floor that grew upward could access a richer supply of settling silatholins. This gradient created selection pressure — an incentive for complexity.

In the liquid-filled void, the equivalent gradient is a **depletion zone**. Every active catalytic site on the wall consumes feedstock locally, creating a region of reduced concentration near the surface. The richest supply of dissolved silatholins is in the bulk liquid, away from any consuming wall. A catalytic structure that extends outward from the wall into the bulk reaches fresh feedstock that its flat-wall competitors cannot access.

This selection pressure is arguably *stronger* in liquid than in gas. Diffusion in liquid ammonia is ~10⁴× slower than in gas (diffusion coefficients ~10⁻⁹ m²/s vs. ~10⁻⁵ m²/s). Depletion zones are steeper and tighter. Reaching even a centimeter further into the bulk liquid gives a dramatic competitive advantage.

### 3. Cracks are better reactors than voids

This is the decisive realization.

In a void — gas-filled or liquid-filled — a molecule at the center might be 15 cm from the nearest catalytic wall. In liquid ammonia, diffusion across that distance takes hours. The rate-limiting step is transport, not reaction.

In a crack with an aperture of a few millimeters, every molecule is within milliseconds of a catalytic wall at all times. Seepage flow forces continuous contact between feedstock and catalyst. There is no bulk interior where molecules can loiter uncommitted.

This is a **packed-bed flow reactor**: narrow channel, catalytic walls, forced flow. It is the workhorse of industrial catalysis, and it outperforms a stirred tank (the void analog) precisely because it eliminates the diffusion bottleneck.

A crack doesn't need a void at its terminus to function as a genesis environment. It needs:

- Liquid ammonia carrying dissolved silatholins, seeping downward under gravity
- Catalytic rock walls (Ni, Fe, Co, Ti — ubiquitous in mafic crust)
- Silane diffusing or seeping upward through the same fracture network
- H₂ escape (upward through the crack, countercurrent to the descending liquid)
- Temperature between ammonia freezing and boiling

These conditions are met in essentially **every wet crack in the upper crust of the terminator zone.**

---

## Three Nested Genesis Environments

The fracture network supports three distinct reactive environments, nested within each other and connected by continuous fluid pathways.

### I. The Seepage Cracks (Primary Genesis Environment)

**Where:** Throughout the upper crust of the terminator zone, from the surface to the ammonia boiling isotherm (roughly 1–3 km depth, depending on local geothermal gradient).

**Physical character:** Fractures in basaltic rock, apertures from sub-millimeter to centimeters, lengths from centimeters to tens of meters. Columnar jointing gives fracture spacings of 0.1–1 m. Every joint, every cooling crack, every fault surface is a potential reactor.

**How it works:** Ammonia rain, carrying dissolved silatholins forged by the permanent storm front, seeps down into the fracture network under gravity. It percolates through cracks whose walls are lined with transition-metal-bearing mafic minerals. Silane gas, generated at depth, diffuses upward through the same network. Where the two streams meet, the catalytic walls strip Si–H bonds (~318 kJ/mol) and N–H bonds (~386 kJ/mol), stitching fragments into larger silazane and carbosilane structures. H₂, the waste product, is buoyant in the liquid and escapes upward.

Every square meter of crack wall is a catalytic surface. Every meter of crack length is a flow reactor. The cracks don't need voids. They don't need a specific geometry. They don't need to be at a precise temperature — any temperature between ~196 K and ~300+ K works.

**The ammonia as backup fuel:** When silane flux is low, the catalytic walls can strip N–H bonds from the solvent itself. Ammonia is a worse hydrogen donor than silane (N–H bonds are ~20% stronger, and ammonia has three H atoms vs. four), but it is present in overwhelming excess. The chemistry shifts — producing more nitrogen-rich intermediates, more silazane backbones rather than polysilane chains — but it doesn't stop. The cracks run lean, not dead.

**Selective advantage:** Catalytic structures that extend into the crack's flow path intercept more feedstock. In narrow cracks, this means growing along the crack axis. In wider cracks, this means growing inward from the wall. Either way, reaching further from the parent surface is rewarded. This is the same "incentive to grow" that operated in the void model, expressed in a different geometry.

**What about the ceiling?** In a liquid-filled crack, there is no gravitational distinction between floor, wall, and ceiling. Catalytic sites on any surface have equal access to dissolved feedstock. However, sites at or near crack inlets — where fresh ammonia enters from above — intercept the richest feedstock first. A catalytic structure that colonizes the inlet of a crack drinks from the firehose and partially starves the crack below.

This creates competition between inlet-colonizers and interior sites, and creates selection pressure for growth *into* the cracks from the surface, not just within the crack network. A successful inlet colonizer eventually narrows its crack, reducing flow, creating a self-limiting feedback — and arguably a primitive precursor to regulated metabolism.

### II. The Boiling Front (Concentration Engine)

**Where:** At the depth where the geothermal gradient raises crack temperature to the local ammonia boiling point. This is a surface — an isotherm — that undulates through the crust, deeper where rock is less conductive, shallower near magmatic intrusions.

**Physical character:** The boundary between liquid-filled cracks above and gas-filled (or steam-filled) cracks below. Not a sharp line but a transition zone, perhaps meters to tens of meters thick, where ammonia is actively boiling.

**How it works:** Descending ammonia reaches the boiling isotherm and evaporates. The ammonia leaves as vapor. The silatholins cannot — they are heavy, complex, involatile. They precipitate at the boiling front, coating whatever crack surface exists there. This is exactly the mechanism that deposits mineral scale in boiler pipes, or that forms quartz veins in terrestrial hydrothermal systems.

The boiling front is a **cold trap for complexity**. Every drop of ammonia that boils away leaves its silatholin cargo behind, concentrated. Over geological time, the boiling front accumulates the heaviest, most complex molecules the system has produced, at concentrations orders of magnitude higher than anywhere in the bulk liquid above.

And what arrives from below to meet this deposit? Silane gas. Fresh fuel, delivered directly to a surface coated with concentrated silatholins, on catalytic rock.

The boiling front is self-maintaining. If silatholin deposits insulate the rock and shift the thermal profile, the front migrates slightly — but it doesn't disappear. If a gas burst scours the deposit, the front re-establishes and deposition resumes. The front tracks the isotherm wherever it goes.

**Selective character:** This environment favors involatility. Molecules that are more complex, heavier, and less volatile are preferentially retained. Simpler molecules escape with the ammonia vapor. The boiling front is a ratchet: complexity in, simplicity out. This is a selection pressure that exists nowhere else in the system, and it operates passively, driven by thermodynamics alone.

### III. The Voids (Sheltered Nurseries)

**Where:** Discrete gas-filled or liquid-filled cavities at fracture intersections, vesicles, lava-tube segments, and collapse features. Scale: centimeters to meters. Distributed throughout the viable depth range.

**Physical character:** The genesis voids of the original model. They exist. There are roughly 10¹³ of them in the terminator zone (the original census stands for this count). But they are embedded within the crack network, not isolated from it.

**How they work in the revised model:** Voids are no longer the *site* of genesis. They are downstream environments, colonized by catalytic chemistry that originated in the cracks. A crack-born catalytic network that grows along its fracture will eventually reach a void — a sudden expansion into open space.

In the void, the constraints change. There is room for large three-dimensional structures. Diffusion distances are long, creating richer gradients and more complex competitive dynamics. The pace of chemistry slows relative to the crack, but the *sophistication* can increase.

The void is not where life starts. It is where life learns to be complicated.

**Thermal constraints on voids:** The original model required voids at 240–265 K (the gas-phase dewpoint window). The revised model has no such constraint. Liquid-filled voids work from ~196 K to the ammonia boiling point (~300–320 K at local pressure). Gas-filled voids above the boiling front work at any temperature where silatholin chemistry is stable (up to ~400+ K for simple silazane bonds). The thermal window for viable voids is roughly **200 K wide**, not 25.

---

## The Revised Census

The fundamental unit is no longer "genesis voids" but **catalytic crack surface area** in the viable zone.

### Terminator Zone Area (A_zone)

Unchanged from the original estimate. The terminator band receiving ammonia rain with suitable volcanic geology spans:

- Band width: ~500–1500 km (central: 1000 km)
- Circumference: ~60,000 km
- Volcanic terrain fraction: 0.3–0.8 (central: 0.5)
- **A_zone ≈ 10⁷ to 10⁸ km² (central: 3 × 10⁷ km²)**

### Viable Depth Window (D_depth)

Dramatically expanded. The lower limit is the surface (or shallow subsurface where ammonia rain first enters cracks). The upper thermal limit is the ammonia boiling isotherm, which depends on the local geothermal gradient.

- Geothermal gradient in terminator zone: 30–80 K/km (elevated by volcanism, but terminator is not the volcanic maximum)
- Surface temperature varies across the band: ~220–280 K
- Ammonia boiling point at local pressure: ~300–320 K
- Temperature rise to boiling: 40–100 K
- Depth to boiling isotherm: 40/80 to 100/30 = **500 m to 3.3 km**

But the system doesn't stop at the boiling front — the front itself is a genesis environment, and gas-phase cracks below it still have silane and catalytic walls (they just lack liquid ammonia as a solvent). Including the boiling-front zone and a modest gas-phase margin below:

**D_depth ≈ 500 m to 4 km (central: ~2 km)**

This is roughly 5× the original estimate of ~400 m. For the liquid-phase crack environments alone, the depth band is at minimum 3× wider.

### Crack Surface Area Per Unit Volume (S_crack)

This replaces V_density (voids per m³). It is the total fracture wall area per cubic meter of rock.

In basaltic rock with columnar jointing:

- Fracture spacing: 0.1–1 m (central: ~0.3 m)
- Each fracture is a roughly planar surface extending through the rock
- For a cubic meter of rock with fracture spacing *d*, the number of fractures per meter in each of three orthogonal directions is ~1/d
- Total crack surface area per m³ ≈ 3 × 2/d = 6/d (factor of 2 because each fracture has two walls)

| Fracture spacing | S_crack (m² per m³) |
|---|---|
| 0.1 m | 60 |
| 0.3 m | 20 |
| 1.0 m | 6 |

At depth, overburden pressure closes fractures. Under 2g gravity, lithostatic pressure at 1 km is ~54 MPa. This reduces apertures and can seal some fractures, but fracture *area* (as opposed to aperture) decreases more slowly — a closed crack still exists as a surface, it's just tighter. Active tectonic and volcanic stress continuously reopens fractures.

Depth correction: S_crack at 1 km depth ≈ 30–60% of surface value.

**S_crack ≈ 2–30 m² per m³ (central: ~10 m² per m³)**

### Fraction of Crack Surface That Is Catalytically Wet (f_wet)

Not all crack surface has liquid ammonia flowing over it. Some cracks are dry (above the water table equivalent — the "ammonia table"), some are sealed, some are in rock that's too far from a connected rain pathway.

In fractured basalt above the percolation threshold, the connected fracture network spans most of the rock volume. The ammonia table in the terminator zone is shallow (continuous rain input at the surface). Below the ammonia table and above the boiling front, most connected cracks should be at least partially wet.

**f_wet ≈ 0.2–0.6 (central: 0.4)**

This subsumes the old f_connected, f_thermal, and f_drainage factors into a single, more physically meaningful term.

### Fraction With Silane Access (f_silane)

Silane generated at depth must percolate upward into the crack network. On a planet with 0.3% SiH₄ in the atmosphere (implying a vigorous global silane flux), deep-crustal generation is widespread. The question is whether every crack system receives some silane or whether it's channeled through discrete conduits.

On Earth, volcanic gas seepage is broadly distributed in volcanic terrain, not solely confined to point sources. Diffuse CO₂ soil flux in volcanic areas like Yellowstone or Campi Flegrei covers hundreds of km². On this planet, with a more reducing mantle and a thermodynamically favored silane generation reaction, diffuse flux should be ubiquitous in volcanic terrain.

However, flux intensity matters. A crack system with trace silane is less reactive than one sitting above a major conduit.

**f_silane ≈ 0.3–0.7 (central: 0.5)**

### The Calculation

```
Total catalytic surface = A_zone × D_depth × S_crack × f_wet × f_silane
```

| Factor | Low | Central | High | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A_zone | 10⁷ | 3 × 10⁷ | 10⁸ | km² = 10¹³ to 10¹⁴ m² |
| D_depth | 500 | 2,000 | 4,000 | m |
| S_crack | 2 | 10 | 30 | m²/m³ |
| f_wet | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.6 | — |
| f_silane | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.7 | — |

**Central estimate:**

1. Viable rock volume: 3 × 10¹³ m² × 2000 m = 6 × 10¹⁶ m³
2. Total crack surface in that volume: 6 × 10¹⁶ × 10 = 6 × 10¹⁷ m²
3. Wet fraction: × 0.4 = 2.4 × 10¹⁷ m²
4. With silane: × 0.5 = **1.2 × 10¹⁷ m²**

**Low estimate:** 10¹³ × 500 × 2 × 0.2 × 0.3 = **6 × 10¹⁴ m²**

**High estimate:** 10¹⁴ × 4000 × 30 × 0.6 × 0.7 = **5 × 10¹⁸ m²**

### Summary: Total Active Catalytic Surface Area

| Scenario | Surface Area (m²) | Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Low | ~10¹⁵ | 2× Earth's total land area |
| Central | ~10¹⁷ | 200× Earth's total surface area |
| High | ~10¹⁸ | All of Jupiter's cloud surface |

**Range: 10¹⁵ to 10¹⁸ m², central ~10¹⁷ m²**

---

## Comparison: Crust vs. Voids

The original void census found ~10¹³ voids with ~0.3 m² of catalytic wall each, for a total catalytic surface of ~3 × 10¹² m².

The crack network provides ~10¹⁷ m² of catalytic surface.

**The crust has roughly 30,000× more catalytic surface than the voids.**

Moreover, the cracks are *better* reactors per unit area. Forced flow through narrow channels eliminates diffusion bottlenecks. Every molecule contacts catalyst on timescales of milliseconds, not hours. The catalytic efficiency per square meter is orders of magnitude higher in a seepage crack than in a void.

The voids are not wrong. They exist, they function, and they may serve an important role as sheltered nurseries for complex late-stage chemistry. But as a measure of the planet's total abiogenetic capacity, they are **rounding error**.

---

## The Boiling Front: Census

The boiling front is a surface, not a volume. Its area is simply the footprint of the viable terminator zone:

**A_front ≈ A_zone = 10⁷ to 10⁸ km² (central: 3 × 10⁷ km²)**

But the boiling front is not a flat plane — it is a fractal surface threading through the fracture network. Its true area is the crack surface area *at* the boiling isotherm, integrated over the transition zone (perhaps 10–50 m thick where active boiling occurs).

Crack area in the boiling zone: A_zone × thickness × S_crack × f_connected

Central: 3 × 10¹³ m² × 30 m × 10 m²/m³ × 0.3 ≈ **3 × 10¹⁵ m²**

This is smaller than the total crack network but still enormous — and it is the most *concentrated* reactive surface in the system. Every square meter is coated with precipitated silatholins at concentrations far exceeding anything in the liquid zone above.

---

## Revised Abiogenesis Probability

### The trial space

The relevant quantity for abiogenesis is not the number of discrete reactors but the total reactive capacity of the system: catalytic surface area × time × reaction rate per unit area.

The crack network provides ~10¹⁷ m² of catalytic surface. At surface-catalyzed reaction rates of even one catalytic cycle per second per μm² (~10¹² cycles/s/m²), the system runs:

- Per year: 10¹⁷ m² × 10¹² s⁻¹m⁻² × 3 × 10⁷ s/yr ≈ **3 × 10³⁶ catalytic events per year**
- Over 10⁸ years: **~10⁴⁴ total catalytic events**
- Over 10⁹ years: **~10⁴⁵ total catalytic events**

For comparison, the void model at 10¹³ voids × 10⁶ cycles/s × 3 × 10⁷ s/yr × 10⁸ yr ≈ 3 × 10³⁴ — roughly 10¹⁰× fewer total events.

### What this means for the probability argument

For abiogenesis to have >50% probability over 10⁹ years:

**p per catalytic event > ~10⁻⁴⁵**

This is a number so small that it makes the question of whether abiogenesis is "probable" almost meaningless. Any process that is physically possible at all — any reaction pathway that is not forbidden by thermodynamics — will occur if you roll 10⁴⁵ dice. The question is not "can it happen" but "how many times does it happen."

At p ~ 10⁻⁴⁰ per event (still unimaginably improbable on a per-trial basis):

- Expected origins over 10⁹ years: 10⁴⁵ × 10⁻⁴⁰ = **~10⁵ independent abiogenesis events**

One hundred thousand independent origins of life.

### Multiple origins and the polyphyletic question

At these numbers, the genesis crust does not produce a single miracle. It produces a **population** of independent lineages, originating at different points in the fracture network, potentially with different chemistries (crack-origin vs. boiling-front-origin vs. void-origin), competing for the same feedstock supply.

The biogeography of early life on this planet is not "life started somewhere and spread." It is "life started everywhere, simultaneously, and competed from day one."

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Which factor matters most?

| Factor | Range (orders of magnitude) | Impact on total |
|---|---|---|
| A_zone | ~1.0 OoM | Moderate |
| D_depth | ~0.9 OoM | Moderate |
| S_crack | ~1.2 OoM | Significant |
| f_wet | ~0.5 OoM | Minor |
| f_silane | ~0.4 OoM | Minor |

Total uncertainty: ~4 orders of magnitude (10¹⁵ to 10¹⁸). This is *less* than the void model's 7 orders of magnitude, because the constraining factors (thermal window, drainage, dual connectivity) have been relaxed or eliminated.

**S_crack** (crack surface area density) is the largest single uncertainty, but it's bounded by well-studied terrestrial analogs. The real uncertainty is in the depth correction — how fast do fractures close under this planet's 2g gravity?

### What if gravity closes fractures faster?

Higher gravity means higher lithostatic pressure at a given depth. If fractures close at 500 m instead of 2 km:

- D_depth drops by ~4×
- S_crack at depth drops by ~2× (fewer open cracks)
- Combined: ~8× reduction
- Central estimate: 10¹⁷ → ~10¹⁶ m²

Still an astonishing number. Gravity is not a kill shot.

### What if volcanism at the terminator is weak?

If the terminator zone is volcanically quiescent (old, cold crust), f_silane drops and the geothermal gradient flattens. In the worst case:

- f_silane: 0.5 → 0.05
- D_depth: 2 km → 500 m (flatter gradient, but boiling isotherm is deeper)
- Combined: ~15× reduction
- Central estimate: 10¹⁷ → ~10¹⁶ m²

Again, not fatal. The crack network is so large that even severe penalties leave enormous reactive surface.

### True kill scenarios

To reduce the catalytic surface below 10¹² m² (comparable to the void model) would require:

- No fractures at all (monolithic, unfractured rock) — contradicted by volcanism
- No liquid ammonia reaching the subsurface — contradicted by 8 bar atmosphere and continuous rain
- No silane flux — contradicted by 0.3% atmospheric SiH₄
- All three at once — geologically implausible

**The genesis crust is robust.** Its existence follows directly from the planet's stated geology and atmosphere. You would have to change the planet's fundamental parameters to eliminate it.

---

## Implications for the Worldbuilding

### Abiogenesis is not a miracle

At 10¹⁵–10¹⁸ m² of catalytic surface operating for 10⁸–10⁹ years, the genesis crust makes abiogenesis an overwhelming statistical certainty, provided the underlying chemistry permits self-replicating catalytic cycles at all. The only real kill switch is chemical, not geological: if no catalytic pathway to self-replication exists in this system, no amount of surface area helps. But if the pathway exists with any nonzero probability, the planet will find it — and find it many times over.

### The voids are nurseries, not birthplaces

Life does not originate in voids. It originates in seepage cracks and possibly at the boiling front, where catalytic throughput is highest and feedstock contact is most intimate. Voids are colonized later, when crack-born catalytic networks grow into larger spaces. The void's contribution is room — space for three-dimensional structures, complex competitive dynamics, and the kinds of spatial organization that may be prerequisites for true metabolism.

### Three regimes, three chemistries?

The three genesis environments — seepage cracks, boiling front, and voids — operate under different physical conditions and may favor different chemical products:

- **Cracks:** Forced contact, rapid turnover, high throughput. Favors efficient, simple catalytic cycles. The "fast food" of genesis chemistry.
- **Boiling front:** Concentrated silatholins, simultaneous access to silane gas, passive selection for involatility and complexity. Favors heavy, elaborate molecules. The "distillery."
- **Voids:** Slow diffusion, spatial competition, long residence times. Favors structures that can extend, compete, and organize in three dimensions. The "nursery."

Whether these regimes produce the same biochemistry or different ones is a chemical question beyond the scope of this estimate. But the possibility of multiple, chemically distinct origins is real — and it would mean the planet's earliest biosphere was not a single tree of life but a **forest of independent experiments**, rooted in different cracks, with different chemistries, competing for the same planet.

### The whole crust is alive

Not metaphorically. The terminator zone's upper crust — perhaps 10⁷ km² in area and 2 km deep — is a single, interconnected catalytic reactor with more active surface than the total area of Earth. Every wet crack is a reaction chamber. Every fracture intersection is a mixing zone. Every boiling front is a concentration engine. The planet does not *have* genesis sites. The planet *is* a genesis site.
