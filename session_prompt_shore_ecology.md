# SESSION PROMPT: Shore / Intertidal Ecology

## Setup

Follow CLAUDE.md session protocol. Load spine (`substrate_spine.md`). Additionally load:
- Bible §9 (Ammonia Sea Ecology) — marine context
- Bible §3.4 (Ammonia Sea Basins) — tower-dependent seas, shore deposition zones
- Spine §SURFACE GEOMORPHOLOGY — shore deposition, atmospheric conveyor
- Spine §AMMONIA SEA ECOLOGY — marine zonation, petrification, medusa-fish, involuntary broadcast
- Spine §EM ECOLOGY — mutual permanent detection, tower as EM shelter

Load on demand (not pre-loaded):
- Pool Genesis Hub §2.5 (pool persistence) — if discussing genesis/terminator shores
- Fauna Structural Hub — if discussing body plans
- Chemistry Hub §10 (ammonia solvent chemistry) — if discussing petrification/distillation

## Context: What's Established

The shore/intertidal zone is asserted as the **richest marine zone** but has almost no developed species, food web, or ecological detail. This session fills that gap.

### Physical Environment (all resolved, do not re-derive)

- **Tower-dependent seas.** Ammonia seas exist only where tower arrays maintain basins via turbulence. Kill the tower → basin fills with aeolian sediment → peneplain reclaims. Terminator basins are primary (densest tower arrays, direct rain supply, fracture-zone topography supplements tower turbulence). Dark-side seas exist only where tower arrays extend past the terminator.

- **Shore deposition zones.** Where katabatic wind (2–8 m/s, laminar free-stream, aerodynamically smooth turbulent boundary layer) meets ammonia surface → waves → roughness → boundary layer trips to turbulent → carrying capacity drops → particulate falls out. Shoreline is the ONE place on the dark side where material accumulates. Deposited material: SiC grit, volcanic fines, dead-bug plume debris (catalytic metals, library fragments, SiC plates).

- **Nutrient delivery.** The atmospheric conveyor feeds shore with a continuous supply of biologically relevant material. This is the primary connection between the atmospheric cycle and the marine ecosystem.

- **Petrification gradient.** Sea H₂O ~50 ppm (8× the 6 ppm "untenable" threshold). Shore organisms face LESS H₂O exposure than deep-sea organisms (shallower water, intermittent exposure, atmospheric SiH₄ access from air). Shore is the most favorable marine environment for silazane biology.

- **Dual SiH₄ access.** Shore organisms can access atmospheric SiH₄ (from air) AND dissolved SiH₄ (from sea surface). This is unique — deep marine organisms have only dissolved SiH₄; land organisms have only atmospheric. Shore gets both.

- **Involuntary broadcast.** Liquid NH₃ (dielectric ~22) converts neural EM emission to near-field ionic/electrical coupling — omnidirectional conduction through solvent. Marine amorphs can't think privately. Shore amorphs are **bilingual** — adapted to operate in both the private-directional world of air and the public-broadcast world of liquid ammonia.

- **Marine buoyancy.** Everything sinks in ammonia (amorph 1050 vs NH₃ 660 kg/m³). H₂ gas bladders provide buoyancy. H₂ is metabolic waste.

- **Medusa-fish mobile reef.** Apex marine organism. Concentrated H₂O weapon (Tesla valve, glass spines). Defenseless organisms cluster in spine corona for protection = mobile habitat node. Marine analog of the tower. Potentially shore-adjacent.

- **Glass-shell diatom analogs.** SiO₂ armor from controlled petrification. Zero SiH₄ cost. Self-passivating. Middle kingdom / microbial marine adaptation.

- **Tower lattice as EM shelter.** Conductive N-doped SiC lattice acts as partial Faraday cage. Shore towers provide EM sanctuary for organisms transitioning between land and sea.

### What Needs Development

1. **Shore food web.** What species/organism types exist? What eats what? Energy flows? Biomass distribution? The shore should be the densest, most diverse marine zone — build it.

2. **Intertidal zonation.** Is there a tidal cycle? (No moon mentioned, but tower-induced wave action creates dynamic water level.) How does the shore zone itself stratify? Splash zone, regularly submerged, permanently submerged, deep? What lives where?

3. **Shore-specific organisms.** What body plans are unique to the shore? Organisms that exploit the air/liquid interface? Sessile filter feeders anchored at the waterline? Amphibious forms?

4. **Bilingual shore amorphs.** The spine says shore amorphs are bilingual (broadcast/private). What does this look like ecologically? Are they translators? Traders? Information brokers between marine and terrestrial amorph populations? What's their social/economic role?

5. **Nutrient cycling.** Atmospheric deposition → shore sediment → marine food web. How does deposited material enter biological circulation? Does it dissolve? Get processed by microbial mats? Filter-fed?

6. **Tower-shore interface.** Towers maintain the seas via turbulence. What happens at the base of a tower where it meets the ammonia? Is the tower root submerged? Does marine life colonize the submerged portion of tower lattice? What's the ecology of the tower-sea interface?

7. **Dead-bug plume processing.** The plume deposits catalytic metals, library fragments, SiC plates at the shore. This is high-value material. Who gets it first? Competition between aerial interceptors (plume hawks from balloon fauna) vs. shore filter feeders vs. marine surface film organisms?

8. **Petrification gradient ecology.** Shore has lower H₂O than deep sea. Does this create a refuge? Are there organisms that can survive at shore H₂O levels but not deeper? Is the shore a nursery for organisms developing anti-petrification defenses before venturing deeper?

## Constraints to Respect

- No plant/animal distinction. No photosynthesis. Energy sources: electrical (tower grid, solar-electric), chemical (SiH₄ metabolism), piezoelectric.
- Middle kingdom = sexual, genomic, rigid body plans. Amorphs = catalytic, reconfigurable. Both present at shore.
- Amorphs sink in ammonia. Any marine amorph needs H₂ buoyancy.
- Petrification is thermodynamically inevitable at >6 ppm H₂O. All marine organisms fight it.
- Biological distillation is the key marine adaptation (glass-lined internal chamber, flash distillation of NH₃ from H₂O).
- Tower-coupled organisms (Healers, Miners, Guards) function only on their co-evolved tower network.
- EM ecology: cognition = emission. Predation strategies apply at shore too.
- Glass spines = baseline marine defense (controlled petrification + wound exposure).

## Output

Develop the shore ecology. Aim for material suitable for a new bible section (§9.5 or expansion of §9.4) and/or a spine entry under AMMONIA SEA ECOLOGY. Resolve as many open questions as possible; flag any that require decisions beyond this session's scope.

Keep the user's preferences in mind: technical peer interaction, pushback when warranted, no ego-boosting. Ask questions when the design space branches.
