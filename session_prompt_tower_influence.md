# Session Focus: Tower Influence Mechanism — First-Principles Derivation

Load CLAUDE.md, then spine (`_temp_spine.md` is the current markdown version). Load the memory architecture hub (`substrate_memory_architecture_hub (3).md`) and the silicon chemistry hub (most recent `substrate_silicon_chemistry_hub`). Load scaffolding (`substrate_scaffolding_v2_1 (9).md`) Section III — specifically the "Tower Retrieval Bias — The Color Cast" subsection, which is marked UNDER REVIEW.

## Context from previous session

The tower evolution chain is now fully resolved. Key facts:
- Towers are piezoelectric. Wind, seismic activity, lightning, photons all induce current.
- Root networks evolved as power grounding systems.
- Inter-tower electronic warfare produced asymmetric encryption (molecular key pairs).
- Amorphs originated as root-network parasites optimizing the tower reward function. Sapience evolved from selection pressure for better exploitation.
- Tower authentication via molecular key pairs: no key = no food.
- Amorph memory is ROM (polysilane, immutable), retrieved via electronic resonance through a semiconductor body. Associative, state-dependent. Current emotional state determines which memories surface.

## The problem

The scaffolding contains a top-down narrative design called "the color cast" — tower EM biasing amorph memory retrieval. It was designed to explain how towers influence terminators and how the tower revelation is discovered in Book Two. But the mechanism was never derived from the physics. It's contrived rather than consequent.

The project's demonstrated principle: once the biology is properly constrained, narrative falls out of it effortlessly. The tower influence mechanism needs the same treatment the tower evolution chain and persistent organizations got — derive it from the established physics (piezoelectric towers, semiconductor amorph bodies, resonance-based memory retrieval, the reward function that amorphs evolved to exploit) and see what actually happens when those systems interact. Whatever emerges will produce its own narrative implications.

## Specific questions to resolve

1. Given the established physics, how DOES the tower's EM environment interact with amorph cognition? What are the actual mechanisms?
2. What is the extent of that influence? Is it subtle (retrieval bias) or structural (shaping what cognition is possible)?
3. How would it differ between terminators (lifelong exposure), daysiders (no exposure, terminator phenotype), and monks (minimal exposure, trained signal discrimination)?
4. How would the influence be discovered? What would the evidence look like?
5. Can the mechanism be weaponized, amplified, or suppressed? By whom?

## Constraint

Do not start from the narrative need (Book Two tower revelation) and work backward to a mechanism. Start from the physics and work forward. If the physics doesn't support the color cast concept, the color cast is wrong and the narrative must adapt.
