# SUBSTRATE — PLANETARY GEOLOGY HUB

**v2.4 — February 2026**

Load with: spine (required), chemistry hub (recommended for SiH₄ metabolism details), pool genesis hub (optional, for sea-basin geology).

> **Bible reference:** Full prose context for geology lives in the bible (`substrate_bible.md` v2.4), §3 (Planet), §4 (Geology), and §17 (Crisis). The `super_earth_analysis.md` companion document contains the preliminary geophysical analysis this hub supersedes and refines.

## Summary

The planet is a 4.2 M⊕ stagnant-lid super-Earth. Heat escapes via continuous day-side plume volcanism, not episodic global lid overturn. The tidal-locking hemispheric asymmetry creates a permanent volcanic hemisphere (day side) separated from the biosphere's primary habitat (terminator) by thousands of km. Volcanism is a chemical hazard, not a thermal one — stellar heating dominates by 1600:1.

The atmospheric SiH₄ budget runs on a one-way cycle with no subduction recycling. As the planet cools, volcanic SiH₄ production declines nonlinearly (tracking hottest mantle volume, not total heat). A secondary H₂O ratchet compounds the decline: volcanic water accumulates permanently because H₂ retention prevents atmospheric self-cleaning. The crisis — tower deaths, biosphere contraction — is the inevitable thermodynamic endpoint of silicon-based life on a stagnant-lid planet.

## 1. Mantle Thermal Model

### Heat Budget

| Parameter | Earth | This Planet | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| Radiogenic heating | ~20 TW | ~84 TW | 4.2× (scales with mass) |
| Primordial heat flow | ~25 TW | ~60 TW | ~2.4× |
| **Total internal heat** | **~47 TW** | **~144 TW** | **~3.1×** |
| Surface area | 5.1×10¹⁴ m² | 1.18×10¹⁵ m² | 2.3× |
| Mean heat flux | 90 mW/m² | ~122 mW/m² | ~1.35× |

Heat flux per unit area is only ~1.35× Earth's. The planet's larger surface area partially compensates for higher heat production.

### Conductive vs Volcanic Heat Loss

Conduction through a stagnant lid (k ≈ 3 W/m·K, ΔT ≈ 1500K, lid ~300 km): **~15 mW/m²**, totalling ~18 TW. That is ~12% of the budget. The remaining **~126 TW must escape through plume volcanism.**

### Magma Production

To deliver 126 TW via erupted magma (cooling ΔT ≈ 1235K, heat capacity ~1 kJ/kg·K): required magma production is **~80–100 km³/yr**. Earth produces ~24 km³/yr delivering ~33 TW. The scaling is roughly linear and physically unremarkable.

## 2. Volcanic Regime

### ✓ Continuous Day-Side Volcanism, Not Episodic Overturn

The preliminary analysis (`super_earth_analysis.md`) proposed Venus-like episodic lid overturn every 300 Myr–1 Gyr. **This is revised.** Tidal locking creates a self-reinforcing hemispheric asymmetry:

1. **Degree-1 mantle convection.** The ~50K surface temperature asymmetry (substellar 265K vs antistellar 215K) is small relative to mantle temperatures but stabilises hemispheric convection over Gyr: upwelling focuses under the day side, downwelling under the dark side.
2. **Thinner day-side lid.** Higher heat flux → thinner lithosphere → easier plume breakthrough → continuous volcanism. Self-reinforcing.
3. **Thick dark-side lid.** Downwelling zone: weak thermal boundary layer → few plumes → lid thickens indefinitely.
4. **Heat budget balanced.** ~126 TW escaping through the day-side hemisphere (~5.9×10¹⁴ m²) gives ~214 mW/m² local volcanic flux — comparable to Earth's ocean-ridge flux (~300 mW/m²). Vigorous but not catastrophic.

Global lid overturn requires heat accumulation under a sealed lid. The day side is never sealed — it is the permanent pressure-release valve.

### Day-Side Volcanic Character

- **10–30 major volcanic provinces simultaneously active**, each comparable to or larger than Earth's Hawaii
- **Individual shield volcanoes** at 100–500 km diameter
- **Periodic flood-basalt events** (LIPs) when a major plume head breaks through, every few to tens of Myr
- **Continuous resurfacing** on ~100 Myr timescales

The day side is essentially one continuous volcanic province at steady state, not a single catastrophic event.

### Dark-Side Exception

The dark side is geologically quiescent but not dead. Anomalously strong plumes may occasionally breach the thick dark-side lid (every ~500 Myr–1 Gyr). These are localised, surprising events — not global overturn.

### ✓ Subsurface SiH₄ Gas Pockets [NEW IN V2.4]

SiH₄ formed by pressure-driven equilibrium at depth (§4) percolates upward through fracture networks. On the day side, volcanism continuously vents these gases to the atmosphere. On the dark side, the thick, cold, stable crust acts as a cap rock. SiH₄-bearing gas can be trapped in subsurface formations — sealed fracture networks, porous rock beneath impermeable strata — and persist for geological timescales because dark-side volcanism is too infrequent (~500 Myr–1 Gyr) to breach most traps.

**Biological significance:** A tower whose deep roots tap a gas pocket receives concentrated SiH₄ at the root — far exceeding the atmospheric diffusion-limited supply. This translates to massive metabolic throughput, grid power surplus, and waste heat (valuable at 215–230K). These are the **gas-pocket monastery towers** (see Economics Hub §7.2).

**⚠ Gas pockets are non-renewable.** No dark-side volcanism to recharge depleted pockets. The geological lottery determines which towers sit on pockets and for how long. Depletion timescale depends on pocket volume and tower draw rate — both poorly constrained (open question).

### ✓ Chemical Hazard, Not Thermal

Stellar heating completely dominates the surface energy budget:

| Source | Power |
|---|---|
| Absorbed stellar radiation | 2.3×10¹⁷ W |
| Internal heat | 1.4×10¹⁴ W |
| **Ratio** | **~1600:1** |

Even a mega-LIP producing 10× the Siberian Traps' energy is negligible against stellar heating. **No volcanic winters. No thermal disruption of ammonia seas.** All volcanic threats are chemical: gas-phase poisoning and the SiH₄/H₂O budget.

## 3. Volcanic Gas Suite

In a reducing mantle at approximately iron-wüstite buffer:

| Gas | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| H₂ | Dominant volcanic volatile (~95–98% by moles) | Adds to atmospheric H₂ (15%) |
| SiH₄ | Biosphere food | Pressure-driven formation at depth (see §4) |
| H₂O | Chronic poison | Suppressed by reducing conditions but never zero |
| H₂S | Sulfur volatile | NH₄HS aerosol precursor; possible regional cooling during major events |
| CH₄ | Carbon volatile | Feeds carbosilane pathway |
| HF | Acute poison | Attacks Si directly; severe locally, dilute globally at 8 bar |
| NH₃ | Nitrogen volatile | Replenishes atmospheric NH₃ |

### HF Threat Assessment (Revised)

`super_earth_analysis.md` flags HF as "potentially the primary mass extinction mechanism." **Overstated.** Even during a worst-case LIP, dilution in the 5.28×10¹⁹ kg atmosphere holds global HF at ~0.02 ppm. HF is a severe local hazard near day-side eruptions and a contributor to chronic stress in ammonia seas, but not a global biosphere-killer. The fluorine biome (spine ✓) arises from this chronic volcanic HF exposure.

### NH₄HS Aerosol Cooling (□ OPEN)

H₂S + NH₃ → NH₄HS (ammonium hydrosulfide): a solid/liquid aerosol at terminator temperatures (~220K sublimation point). Major volcanic H₂S injection could create haze layers → increased albedo → regional cooling. This is Jupiter's brown cloud chemistry. **Magnitude and duration unquantified.**

---

## 4. SiH₄ Budget

### Source Mechanism

**✓ Pressure-driven equilibrium:**

```
Si(metal/silicide) + 2H₂(g) → SiH₄(g)
```

Δn_gas = −1, so **high pressure favours SiH₄** (Le Chatelier). The reaction is endothermic, so K increases with T (van 't Hoff), but the entropy penalty (Δn_gas = −1) caps K at ~10⁻⁴ regardless of temperature. **Pressure provides the dominant leverage** (P(SiH₄) ∝ P(H₂)²); temperature contributes but cannot drive the reaction alone. At 100 km depth, P(H₂) ≈ 8,000 bar and T ≈ 1500K, giving equilibrium P(SiH₄) ≈ 460 bar (~0.9% of pore gas). SiH₄ is kinetically trapped during magma ascent (reverse reaction frozen below ~400°C) and degasses at the surface.

| Depth | P(H₂) | Equilibrium SiH₄ | Mole fraction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Surface | 1.2 bar | ~10⁻⁵ bar | negligible |
| 50 km | ~400 bar | ~1.2 bar | ~0.05% |
| 100 km | ~8,000 bar | ~460 bar | ~0.9% |
| 200 km | ~16,000 bar | ~1,840 bar | ~1.7% |

### Quantitative Budget (Steady-State)

| Component | SiH₄ (Tg/yr) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Volcanic production (peak)** | **~1000** | 90 km³/yr magma × ~0.1% SiH₄ by mass |
| Tower consumption | ~300 | ~10⁷ towers × ~300 tonnes/yr (diffusion-limited) |
| Amorph consumption | ~100 | ~2 Gt biomass × 58 kg SiH₄/(kg·yr) |
| Lightning processing (net) | ~75 | ~15% of total; products mostly recycled as biological feedstock |
| Photolysis + abiotic | ~25 | Very slow: low UV, NH₃ shielding |
| **Balance** | **~0** | Steady state at 0.3 vol% SiH₄ |

Atmospheric SiH₄ inventory: **2.5×10¹⁷ kg**. Residence time: ~500,000 yr.

Confidence: order of magnitude constrained; individual terms uncertain by factors of 2–5. The budget balances, which is the primary cross-check.

### ✓ One-Way Silicon Cycle

```
Mantle Si + deep H₂ → SiH₄ (volcanic)
        ↓
Atmosphere SiH₄
        ↓
Biology: SiH₄ → Si + 2H₂
        ↓
SiC lattice / SiO₂ glass / sedimentary deposits (PERMANENT)
        ↓
█ NO RETURN TO MANTLE █ (no subduction)
```

On Earth, the carbon cycle closes via subduction: surface carbonates are recycled into the mantle, regenerating CO₂. On a stagnant-lid planet there is no subduction. Surface silicon deposits are permanent. The atmospheric SiH₄ runs on a one-way tank recharged only by fresh mantle processing. The crisis was inevitable from the moment life evolved.

### Nonlinear Decline

SiH₄ production does not decline linearly with volcanic heat output. It has a **temperature threshold**: the equilibrium requires mantle zones above ~1500K with high H₂ fugacity. As the planet cools, the volume of mantle above this threshold shrinks nonlinearly — tracking the tail of the temperature distribution, not the mean.

The biosphere had billions of years of abundant SiH₄. The decline was imperceptible for most of the planet's history. In the last ~500 Myr the decline has accelerated. The next ~500 Myr will see a dramatic dropoff.

### Crisis Threshold

Organisms acquire SiH₄ by passive diffusion. Flux scales linearly with partial pressure.

| SiH₄ (vol%) | Effect |
|---|---|
| 0.3 | Current: full biosphere |
| 0.2 | Marginal towers fail (poorest diffusion access) |
| 0.15 | Widespread tower death; amorphs must shrink or slow metabolism |
| 0.1 | Only well-positioned towers survive; amorph populations contract severely |
| 0.05 | Surface biosphere collapse |
| <0.01 | Deep-rock continues indefinitely on geothermal SiH₄ |

First tower deaths (spine: "first in history") imply current SiH₄ is near **~0.25%**, recently crossed below the viability threshold at the margins.

## 5. H₂O Ratchet

### Mechanism

Volcanic H₂O is a minor but nonzero component of volcanic gas (H₂O/H₂ ≈ 0.01–0.1 at iron-wüstite buffer). Estimated volcanic H₂O production: **~200 Tg/yr** (range 50–400).

Three mechanisms prevent the atmosphere from self-cleaning:

1. **H₂ retention.** v_esc = 18.6 km/s; H₂ thermal velocity at 265K ≈ 1.8 km/s. Thermal H₂ escape is essentially zero. H₂O photolysis (H₂O → H₂ + O) is reversible because the H₂ product stays — it recombines with O to regenerate H₂O. No permanent H₂O loss to space.
2. **NH₃ UV shielding.** H₂O photolysis requires λ < 240 nm. NH₃ (12.5% of 8 bar atmosphere) absorbs strongly below 230 nm, intercepting nearly all relevant photons before they reach H₂O. Photolysis-driven atmospheric chemistry is negligible.
3. **No thermal reaction.** SiH₄ + H₂O → products does not proceed at 240K without catalysis.

### H₂O Sinks

| Sink | Rate (Tg/yr) | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Reaction with native metals on fresh volcanic surfaces | ~50–100 | Declines as day-side rocks weather between resurfacing events |
| Mineral weathering of reduced silicates | ~50–100 | Slow, cumulative, finite |
| Biological petrification (H₂O + Si-NH-Si → Si-O-Si + NH₃) | ~10–30 | Consumes H₂O but destroys organisms |
| Dissolution in ammonia seas | Reservoir | Accumulates; not a permanent sink |
| **Net accumulation** | **~50–100** | H₂O builds in seas and atmosphere over Gyr |

### Pre-Crisis Scavenging

In the pre-crisis steady state, surplus SiH₄ scavenges volcanic H₂O at the volcanic source:

```
SiH₄ + 2H₂O → SiO₂(dust) + 4H₂     [proceeds at >400°C on hot volcanic surfaces]
```

Volcanic gas has SiH₄/H₂O ≈ 6:1 by mass (stoichiometric need: 0.89:1). All H₂O is consumed before leaving the volcanic province. **No H₂O reaches the wider atmosphere.**

### Crisis Transition

When biological consumption eats into the SiH₄ surplus so that less remains than needed for H₂O scavenging, unscavenged H₂O escapes to the wider atmosphere. It dissolves in ammonia seas and condenses at the terminator — a chronic petrification agent wherever it contacts biological tissue.

### Three-Stage History

| Era | Duration | H₂O balance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Early** (0–3 Gyr) | 3 Gyr | Net sink | Abundant fresh metal surfaces consume most volcanic H₂O |
| **Middle** (3–5 Gyr) | 2 Gyr | Approaching balance | Surface sinks saturating; SiH₄ surplus still scavenges the rest |
| **Late** (5–7 Gyr) | 2 Gyr | Net accumulation | Sinks exhausted, SiH₄ surplus shrinking. H₂O building in seas |
| **Crisis** (7+ Gyr = now) | — | Accumulation accelerating | SiH₄ deficit → scavenging fails → H₂O enters wider atmosphere |

---

## 6. Petrification Chemistry

### Thermodynamics

The hydrolysis of silazane bonds is strongly exothermic:

```
≡Si-NH-Si≡ + H₂O → ≡Si-O-Si≡ + NH₃     ΔH ≈ -24 kJ/mol
```

Si-O bonds are 97 kJ/mol stronger than Si-N. Entropy change is negligible (same bond count each side). At 240K:

K = exp(24000/(8.314 × 240)) ≈ **1.6 × 10⁵**

In liquid ammonia (a(NH₃) ≈ 1), the equilibrium ratio of petrified to living bonds is:

**[Si-O-Si]/[Si-N-Si] = K × x(H₂O)**

| Sea H₂O (mol%) | Equilibrium Si-O/Si-N | % Bonds Petrified |
|---|---|---|
| 6 ppm | 1.0 | 50% |
| 100 ppm (0.01%) | 16 | 94% |
| 0.1% | 160 | 99.4% |
| 1% | 1,600 | 99.94% |

**✓ Silazane bonds are thermodynamically untenable above ~6 ppm H₂O in liquid ammonia.** Organisms maintain silazane structures only through active metabolic repair — exactly as Earth organisms maintain reduced carbon in an O₂ atmosphere. When metabolism stops, petrification proceeds to equilibrium. This is the silicon-world analog of decomposition.

### Kinetics

Silazane hydrolysis at 298K: fast (minutes to hours for monomeric silazanes, slower for cross-linked networks). Estimated Ea ≈ 50–80 kJ/mol.

| Factor | Effect on rate | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| Low temperature (240K vs 298K) | 60–1500× slower | Slows |
| OH⁻ catalysis (H₂O is acid in NH₃: H₂O + NH₃ → NH₄⁺ + OH⁻) | OH⁻ is stronger nucleophile than H₂O | Speeds |
| Cross-linked biological polysilazane (vs monomeric HMDS) | Network resists reorganisation, 10–100× slower | Slows |

**Net estimate for unprotected biological silazane at 1% H₂O, 240K in liquid NH₃:** half-life of exposed Si-N bonds on the order of **days to weeks**. Error bar: ±1 order of magnitude (hours to months).

### Biological Defense

Organisms have coexisted with trace H₂O since the seas formed. Pre-crisis sea H₂O: estimated **~50 ppm** from non-volcanic sources (hydrothermal injection, meteoritic delivery, photochemistry). At 50 ppm, equilibrium says ~89% of exposed silazane bonds should be petrified — organisms have ALWAYS been fighting this. Defense mechanisms evolved:

1. **Silazane oil membrane.** Hydrophobic barrier limiting H₂O contact with internal structure. First line of defense.
2. **Active ammonolysis repair.** Si-O-Si + NH₃ → Si-NH-Si + H₂O (reverse reaction). Energetically costly; fights K ≈ 10⁵. At 50 ppm sea H₂O, every repaired bond faces re-attack — running up a down escalator.
3. **SiH₄-powered reconstruction.** Rebuilding petrified structures from scratch using atmospheric SiH₄. **Directly coupled to SiH₄ supply** — the mechanism linking the two crises.

**[NEW IN V2.3] Body-size-dependent defense strategies:**

- **Large amorphs:** Membrane maintenance, continuous surface turnover, SiC deployment at critical junctions, behavioral avoidance of H₂O-rich environments. Shed glass patches — rigid glass incompatible with reconfigurable body plan.
- **Middle Kingdom / microbial:** Some lineages evolved SiO₂ glass shells (diatom analogs). Controlled surface petrification → self-passivating armor. SiO₂ is at the thermodynamic floor (Chemistry Hub §1: "you can't oxidize something that's already at the thermodynamic floor"). Benefits: zero SiH₄ cost, self-healing (any scratch re-petrifies), transparent. A successful marine adaptation.
- **Undefended tissue:** Petrification scabs form and are ejected (not retained) by most organisms — rigid glass inclusions are dead weight in flexible body plans. Exception: glass-shell organisms evolved to keep them.

**[NEW IN V2.3] Petrification as aging mechanism:** Cumulative unrepairable petrification scars → progressive stiffening → eventual metabolic failure. Glass fossils are the endpoint of a lifelong losing battle against K ≈ 10⁵. Decomposition = thermodynamics completing the conversion that metabolism held at bay.

**[NEW IN V2.3] Acute exposure ("getting glassed"):** Surface petrification from acute H₂O contact is self-limiting (Deal-Grove model: glass layer thickness grows as √t, slowing further penetration). For a large amorph in sustained H₂O vapor (volcanic vent scenario): ~2–3 mm depth after 1 hour, ~10–15% body mass loss. Survivable — crack and discard glass shell. Severity scales with dose (volume of H₂O), location (bulk tissue vs sensory patches / neural structures / respiratory surfaces), and inversely with body size. Surface splash between large amorphs: prank-tier. Internal delivery: potentially lethal (no self-passivation benefit when glass forms inside functional structures).

### Crisis Coupling

The SiH₄ crisis and petrification crisis are not independent. They compound:

- Less SiH₄ → less metabolic energy → less repair budget
- Less repair → more petrification damage per unit time
- Meanwhile H₂O accumulates (scavenging fails) → higher H₂O → faster attack
- Organisms must choose between growth/reproduction and anti-petrification defense

### Vulnerability Gradient

| Population | H₂O Exposure | SiH₄ Access | Vulnerability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deep-sea organisms | Immersed; highest | Diffusion-limited | **First to fail** |
| Shallow-sea / coastal | Immersed; high | Better (atmosphere) | Second |
| Land organisms (terminator) | Rain/frost only | Atmospheric | Third |
| Tower symbiotes | Minimal (elevated, wind-dried) | Tower flux | Last — die of starvation, not petrification |

**Distillation shield:** Evaporation preferentially lifts NH₃ over H₂O (NH₃ vapor pressure >> H₂O at 240K). Ammonia rain is relatively H₂O-poor; the seas concentrate H₂O. Land organisms are partially protected by atmospheric distillation.

### ✓ Resolved

Aquatic petrification is a **thermodynamic certainty** once sea H₂O exceeds ~100 ppm, limited only by kinetics and biological defense. It is the primary kill mechanism for ammonia-sea life, preceding and compounding the SiH₄ starvation that kills the surface/tower biosphere. Sea organisms are the canary.

### □ Open: Kinetic Rate

The single largest uncertainty. Effective Ea for hydrolysis of defended biological silazane at 240K in NH₃ solution determines whether petrification is:
- An acute, visible kill (Ea < 50 kJ/mol; hours to days)
- A chronic wasting disease (Ea ≈ 65 kJ/mol; weeks to months)
- A slow background drain (Ea > 80 kJ/mol; years)

This is not constrainable from first principles for hypothetical biochemistry. It is a **narrative knob**.

## 7. Integrated Crisis Model

```
CRISIS = SiH₄ decline (primary) + H₂O accumulation (secondary)
              ↓                              ↓
       food supply shrinking          poison load growing
              ↓                              ↓
       tower metabolism fails        petrification stress rises
              ↓                              ↓
       tower deaths begin            sea organisms fail first
              ↓                              ↓
       biosphere contracts  ←——→  reduced biological H₂O sink
                          ↘        ↙
                    positive feedback
                   (accelerating decline)
```

The two drivers compound: less SiH₄ → biosphere contracts → fewer organisms scavenging H₂O → H₂O accumulates faster → more petrification → further contraction. But declining volcanism also produces less new H₂O, partially offsetting the accumulation. Net: SiH₄ decline is the primary driver; the H₂O ratchet is a compounding secondary effect.

### Deep-Rock Survival

**✓ Confirmed.** The deep-rock biosphere uses geothermal SiH₄ (percolating through fractures), not atmospheric. It is insulated from both SiH₄ decline and H₂O accumulation. Only direct volcanic penetration of its fracture network threatens it (day side: regularly pruned; dark side: almost never). The trunk survives; only the branches die.

---

## 8. Hemispheric Asymmetry Summary

| Property | Day Side | Terminator | Dark Side |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lithosphere | ~100–200 km | Variable (flexure) | ~400–600 km |
| Mantle convection | Upwelling | Transitional | Downwelling |
| Volcanism | Continuous, ~10–30 provinces | None | Rare (~500 Myr–1 Gyr plume breakthrough) |
| Resurfacing | ~100 Myr | N/A (wind-eroded peneplain) | >1 Gyr, possibly never |
| Deep-rock biosphere | Young, pruned by volcanism | Chronic fracture networks | Ancient, uninterrupted |
| Surface biosphere | Sparse (fluorine ecology) | Dense (tower factory) | Sparse (singing zone, monks) |
| Acoustic environment | Volcanic rumble, no storms | **Continuous thunder at 8 bar — shockwave bombardment** | Silent (no storms, gentle wind) |

The asymmetry is self-reinforcing and stable over the planet's lifetime.

### Surface Geomorphology [NEW IN V2.4]

**Dark side: SiC-polished bedrock peneplain.** Three factors combine: (1) no constructive geology (no volcanism, no tectonics, no uplift); (2) continuous SiC abrasion from the dead-bug plume feeding SiC particulate (Mohs 9.5) into the atmospheric conveyor — SiC abrading silicate bedrock (Mohs 6-7) for billions of years produces mirror-smooth surfaces; (3) no net accumulation (the atmospheric particulate conveyor is a closed loop — see below). Two distinct regimes: free-stream flow is genuinely laminar (stably stratified, no convection, no weather); surface boundary layer is aerodynamically smooth turbulent (Re ~10¹², roughness < viscous sublayer ~50 μm). Both → only towers generate significant turbulence. All topographic complexity on the dark side is tower-generated.

**Atmospheric particulate conveyor (closed loop).** Day-side volcanism → surface winds carry particulate to substellar chimney → chimney lofts fines into superstream (chimney = grain-size filter: only material light enough to be vertically lofted enters) → superstream carries to anti-stellar downdraft (velocity increases via spherical convergence — anything past the terminator goes the distance) → deposition → katabatic winds re-entrain → return to day side. Loop closes because chimney pre-selects for particle sizes the katabatic wind can handle. No cyclonic activity at convergence points to enhance this (both on equator, f = 0; Rossby deformation radius exceeds planetary radius). Minor exception: **anti-stellar dust cap** — katabatic wind starts at ~0 m/s at the stagnation point, so the finest fraction of downdraft material may accumulate locally. Self-limiting and geologically insignificant (small zone, any accumulation reduces the thermal gradient driving the katabatic flow).

**Day side: volcanic terrain.** Construction-dominated near substellar (shield volcanoes, flood basalt provinces, fresh surfaces). Erosion increases toward terminator (yardangs, ventifacts, streamlined ridges oriented radially toward substellar). Day-side deposition zone 20–40° from terminator: deep sediment (km).

**Ammonia sea basins are tower-dependent (modern era).** Any depression is a sediment trap: atmospheric fallout drops at shore where wind meets liquid (wave turbulence trips boundary layer), all particulate sinks in ammonia, basin fills. Towers break the aerodynamically smooth boundary layer → scour basins and depositional features → topography that holds ammonia. Kill the tower, basin fills, peneplain reclaims it. Shores are the primary nutrient delivery system for the marine ecosystem (atmospheric particulate accumulates at the wind/liquid interface).

**Genesis environment:** Proto-tower SiC outcrops (deep-rock colony surface expressions) shelter ammonia pools at the terminator. Not merely geomorphological shelter — a genesis reactor. The proto-tower's fracture network provides geothermal SiH₄ venting, metal-enriched fluids (all four biometals via hydrothermal circulation), warm fluids (+5–20K), and N-doped SiC semiconductor substrate. The monadnock acts as a lightning rod, concentrating Miller-Urey products into adjacent pools. Differential erosion ratio ~100,000:1 (SiC vs silicate terrain; volcanic SiC is only ~0.08% of conveyor particulate). Monadnock survives >1 Gyr without symbiote support. Pre-biotic silicate terrain erodes at ~600 mm/Myr — natural depressions are short-lived; only monadnock-sheltered pools persist long enough for genesis. Organisms born in the tower's resource shadow are pre-adapted for symbiosis (preadaptation gradient). One-way door: pre-biotic volcanic SiC already erodes natural topography; biological SiC (dead-bug plume) later accelerates dramatically. See Pool Genesis Hub §2.5 and `v2.4_volcanic_sic_analysis.md`.

### Terminator Acoustic Environment [NEW IN V2.4]

Thunder is a shockwave: the lightning channel superheats atmosphere to ~30,000K, the plasma column expands supersonically into the surrounding gas. At 8 bar, the expanding channel accelerates 8× the air mass of an equivalent strike on Earth. The resulting overpressure pulse is proportionally more intense.

The terminator has continuous lightning (triboelectric + low dielectric strength; spine §Lightning). Continuous lightning = continuous thunder. This is not weather — it is an unbroken acoustic bombardment. Peak overpressure from nearby strikes is physically damaging, not merely loud. The terminator soundscape is a permanent barrage of shockwaves overlapping at all ranges.

Biological consequences:
- Tower symbiotes evolved under this pressure. Overpressure tolerance is a baseline adaptation for all terminator life (see Fauna Hub §5.6).
- Tower lattice interior provides acoustic shielding — the porous structure baffles and attenuates shockwaves. This is a selection pressure on tower morphology alongside wind resistance and gas exchange.
- Dark-side organisms lack this adaptation. A monk visiting the terminator would find the acoustic environment physically punishing.
- The contrast between terminator (continuous shockwave) and dark side (silence) is one of the most extreme environmental gradients on the planet.

## 9. Open Questions

□ **Planet age.** ~7 Gyr is proposed (consistent with crisis onset, complex-life evolution, M-dwarf lifetime). Not yet committed. This is a narrative tuning knob.

□ **SiH₄ temperature threshold.** The exact mantle temperature marking the production cliff determines crisis steepness. Constraining this would tighten the timeline.

□ **Ammonia-sea H₂O content.** Pre-crisis: ~50 ppm estimated (hydrothermal injection, meteoritic delivery, photochemistry). Crisis-era: rising toward 0.1–1% over ~100–500 Myr. Fresh terminator pools <1 ppm (distillation shield). Constraining pre-crisis sea value determines chronic metabolic tax on marine life.

□ **Petrification kinetics.** Effective Ea for biological silazane hydrolysis at 240K in NH₃ — the single largest uncertainty in the aquatic crisis timeline. Narrative knob (see §6).

□ **NH₄HS aerosol cooling.** Could volcanic H₂S → NH₄HS haze events produce measurable climate perturbations at the terminator? Magnitude and duration unquantified.

□ **Tower count and per-tower SiH₄ consumption.** Biggest uncertainty in the biological side of the budget. Constraining tower density at the terminator would tighten the SiH₄ budget significantly.

□ **Dark-side plume events.** What does a rare volcanic event on the ancient, stable dark side look like? How does the dark-side deep-rock biosphere respond? Potential narrative material.

□ **Gas pocket characterization.** Typical pocket volume, SiH₄ concentration, depletion timescale at monastery-level draw, number of viable pockets on the dark side. Constraining these sets the monastic economy's lifespan and the urgency of the day-side power motivation.
