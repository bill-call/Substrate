**SUBSTRATE**

Hub Document --- Fauna, Ecology, and Predation

February 2026 --- Established through conversation

This document collects all established material on non-balloon surface
fauna, tower ecology, predation, and the arms races. Skywhales are
covered in their own hub document (substrate_skywhale_hub.docx). Balloon
fauna and tower airspace ecology are covered in the tower lifecycle
addendum (substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx, Section 10.7). Where the two
ecologies interact (e.g., tower airspace ecology, the dispersal exodus),
cross-references are noted.

This document also introduces material from V2.2 conversations: the
aerogel tower structure and its acoustic properties, the acoustic
predator lineage, and the implications of tower acoustics for amorph
habitability.

**⚠ CLASSIFICATION NOTE [V2.4]:** The plant/animal distinction does
not apply to this biosphere. Every organism runs on the same currency
(electrical charge) from different sources. There is no
photosynthesis, no autotroph/heterotroph divide, no producer/consumer
trophic separation. The actual organizing axes are: phylogeny
(meme-based amorph vs. genome-based sexual), energy source
(tower-coupled vs. tower-independent), and motility (sessile vs.
mobile). Terms like "thorn-plant" and "flora" are convenience labels
only. See Fluorine Ecology Hub §1.1 for full treatment.

**1. THE THREE-TIER LIFE ARCHITECTURE**

**1.1 Scale Determines Body Plan**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Life evolves along two separate chemical tracks,
producing three size tiers. Microbial life and megafauna tend to
catalytic, amorph chemistry (no body plan, thermodynamic minimum
morphology, reproduction by division/merge). In between: sexual
organisms with real genomes and fixed body plans.

**Microbial Tier**

No body plan needed. Self-sustaining autocatalytic networks in silicone
oil find shape through thermodynamics. Reproduction by division,
horizontal fragment exchange. No species boundaries. A continuous
chemical ecology. Amorph because amorph is the default --- it requires
the least information to build.

**Middle Kingdom**

Too large to be a simple catalytic droplet, too small to be a
reconfigurable generalist. Structure is essential --- skeleton,
exoskeleton, rigid body architecture for doing one thing well (run,
bite, fly, burrow, resist predation through armor). A body plan requires
a genome --- a stable set of instructions copied faithfully across
generations. Sexual reproduction enables recombination. Speciation is
real. The middle kingdom has species in the terrestrial sense.

Size range: millimeter to low centimeter scale. Crushed by the
square-cube law in 1.82g. Rigid-bodied. Tower-locked electrical
mutualists --- they tap the tower's conductive lattice for energy via
inductive coupling, direct contact, or galvanic harvesting. Without
metabolic processing organs, fuel storage, or digestive systems (beyond
minimal material intake), their mass budget goes almost entirely to
structure, sensors, and reproduction. This is exactly what small-scale
1.82g demands.

**✓ RESOLVED:** The entire middle kingdom is reef fauna. The tower
provides structure and energy. They live on the lattice, in the lattice,
among the lattice. Away from towers, on open ground, they are almost
absent --- energetically barren for organisms that cannot self-power.
Only amorphs (self-powering, carrying their own fuel) can cross the
gaps.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Middle-kingdom organisms do not inherit memories.
Individual learning only. Network manages them via crude EM field
modulation (tropism), not subtle behavioral suggestion. They are
hardware peripherals running on a firmware the network can't update.

**Megafauna Tier**

Generality beats specialization again. The amorph body plan ("no plan")
works because the organism is large enough, smart enough, and
metabolically flexible enough to reconfigure in real time. Pseudopods,
peristalsis, variable rigidity. Megafauna amorphs including the
Collectors (civilized lineage), decomposers, and the balloon fauna
lineage.

Cognitive consequences of merge: amorphs inherit memories across
generations. A young amorph carries the experiential knowledge of its
predecessors. This is the foundation of Collector intelligence and the
only path to tool use on the planet (see Section 7).

**Size Scaling and Mobility**

*\[NEW --- V2.2 --- full treatment in substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx
Section 12\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** Mobile megafauna amorphs are small: mouse to cat scale.
Large enough for complex cognition and tool manipulation. Small enough
to climb, cross gaps, and navigate terrain under their own metabolic
power in 1.82g. There is no hard upper limit on amorph size, but the
square-cube law makes self-powered locomotion over terrain prohibitive
above a certain mass.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Large amorphs (elder Collectors, monks) are root-locked:
they can move by spreading thin on many pseudopods, but only along the
surface root network where they can draw energy from the tower grid. On
open ground they would drain their reserves in meters. The root network
is the road network. The network controls where roots go, therefore
controls where the largest, smartest amorphs can travel.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Megafauna amorphs are too large to live inside the
tower's aerogel lattice. They live on the ground, around and between
towers. The towers are landscape features, not homes. This has
fundamental implications for the acoustic threat model (Section 5.2) and
for subwoofer prey ecology (Section 6.9).

---------

**2. MIDDLE-KINGDOM TOWER FAUNA**

**2.1 Grazers**

**✓ RESOLVED:** SiC-armored. Chelation immune response produces
laser-cavity geometry (→ Warfare Hub §5.2 for weaponized exaptation in day-side lineages). Voronoi tessellation crack-arrest armor.
Body-plan encoded in library. Grazers scrape the tower's photovoltaic
film --- the symbiote surface layer --- feeding on the energy-rich
biomaterial.

The network manages grazers via EM field modulation, nudging herds away
from critical photovoltaic surfaces. This management is tropistic ---
the grazers respond to field gradients the way terrestrial organisms
respond to chemical gradients. They do not understand the signal. They
follow it.

**2.2 Predators**

**✓ RESOLVED:** SiC penetrator projectiles launched by railgun
mechanism. Real-time structural analysis of prey armor --- the most
cognitively sophisticated middle-kingdom hunters. Stealth surface
chemistry to avoid detection.

The arms race between grazer armor and predator penetrators drove neural
complexity in the middle kingdom. Real-time structural analysis of
Voronoi-tessellated armor requires sophisticated sensory processing. The
predators are the smartest middle-kingdom organisms, and they are still
running on hardwired behavioral programs refined by sexual selection.

**2.3 Sessile Majority**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Most middle-kingdom organisms are sessile. Attached to a
lattice junction for life. Born there, die there. The mobile fraction
--- small grazers, predators, dispersal morphs --- are the minority.
When a tower dies, the sessile majority does not leave. It turns off.
Silently. In place. Only the mobile minority launches from the leeward
face as the surfer exodus.

The sessile majority constitutes 95%+ of tower biomass. Their death is
invisible. The surfer exodus --- millions of small mobile organisms
streaming from the leeward face --- is the visible symptom of total
systems failure, but it represents a tiny fraction of what is dying.

**2.4 The Ants: Logistics Organisms**

*\[EXPANDED --- V2.2 --- full treatment in
substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** A specialized mobile middle-kingdom lineage serves as
the root network's logistics system. They transport construction
material along EM field gradients --- the same tropistic response as all
middle-kingdom EM management, applied to material transport. EM fields
and free electrons function as pheromone trails: stronger signal → more
ants → more material → healthier lattice → stronger signal. Positive
feedback. Self-pruning when paths die.

One adaptation serves all phases of tower lifecycle: root extension,
tower nucleation, tower growth, deposition-zone feeding. The ants follow
the gradient. Up, down, lateral --- they do not distinguish. The network
points. The ants walk. See substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx Section 10.3.3
for full treatment.

---------

**3. THE ARMS RACES**

**3.1 First Arms Race: Armor vs. Penetrators**

Grazer armor (Voronoi tessellation, crack-arrest geometry, chelation
immune response) versus predator penetrators (SiC micropenetrators,
railgun launch, real-time structural analysis). This drove the evolution
of neural complexity in the middle kingdom. The predators developed the
most sophisticated sensory processing on the planet at insect scale.

**3.2 Second Arms Race: Fiber Composite vs. Predator Strategies**

The Collector fiber-composite revolution changed the game. Carbosilane
fiber composite is tougher than grazer bulk SiC, self-repairing (living
matrix), with no catastrophic failure mode. Predator responses to this
new material:

**Sustained-damage:** jackhammer strategies, repeated impact to
overwhelm self-repair rate. **Chemical:** matrix digestion, enzymatic
attack on the carbosilane binding chemistry. **Thermal:** localized
heating to degrade the polymer matrix. **Social:** pack hunting to
attack from multiple directions simultaneously, overwhelming a single
organism's ability to defend all surfaces.

**3.3 Third Arms Race: Acoustic Predation**

*\[NEW --- V2.2\]*

Neither armor nor fiber composite defends against this. See Section 6
for full treatment.

---------

**4. FLUORINE ECOLOGY**

**4.1 The Fluorine Weapon**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine attacks Si-Si bonds, producing SiF₄ (a gas).
Affected tissue volatilizes rather than corroding. The reaction is
catalytically aggressive --- microlitres of elemental fluorine delivered
to a silicon-polymer interior propagate an expanding cavity. The wound
hisses as solid flesh becomes gas. No other weapon on the planet does
this.

Fluorine biochemistry is an entire adaptive radiation, concentrated
around volcanic provinces where fluoride minerals are accessible. Not
one lineage or one niche --- an ecological axis. Analogous to venom
ecology on Earth but more fundamental because the toxin attacks the
structural chemistry that all life shares.

**4.2 Fluorine-Thorn "Flora" (sessile solar-electric sexual lineage)**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Sessile organisms with fluorine-loaded ceramic thorns
(sacrificial, designed to break off and embed, leaking payload). The
volcanic provinces are ecologically alien: a biome where the dominant
selective pressure is chemical warfare using the one element that can
destroy anyone.

The fluorine-thorn flora creates refugia --- dense toxic hedgerows
sheltering fluorine-tolerant microfauna. A biome-within-a-biome,
protected by chemistry.

**4.3 Fluorine Pollination**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine-thorn flora reproduce sexually (they have body
plans and real genomes). Pollinators are attracted not by nectar but by
the toxin itself. Organisms visit thorn-plants to harvest fluorine for
their own offensive/defensive use. They deplete their reserves through
combat, return to reload, and pollinate in the process. The plants'
reproductive success is coupled to the combat frequency of their
pollinators.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Primary pollinators are small free-ranging amorph
organisms (self-powered, ground-ranging on volcanic substrate), NOT
middle-kingdom tower fauna (which are tower-locked and cannot reach the
plants).

The most violent members of the ecosystem are the best pollinators.
Selection favors plants that cater to heavy users.

**4.4 Aposematic EM Signatures**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Small fluorine-carrying organisms broadcast distinctive
EM patterns that predators learn to associate with "if you eat me, your
mouth volatilizes." In amorphs, one bad experience propagates through
merge/meme-mixing permanently --- the entire lineage learns from one
individual's mistake. Against sexual middle-kingdom predators, each
generation must learn the lesson independently. The asymmetry favors
fluorine defense against genomic predators.

**4.5 Biomagnification**

Specialist predators evolve fluorine tolerance, eat fluorine-loaded
organisms, concentrate fluorine secondhand. Apex predators of volcanic
provinces carry the highest fluorine loads without visiting plants
directly. The element cycles through the biome: plants concentrate from
geological source, pollinators harvest from plants, predators
concentrate from pollinators.

Civilizational implication: fluorine-thorn harvesting as specialized
dangerous craft. Harvested fluorine enables precision machining,
metallurgy, and fluorine weapons (their nuclear-weapon analog).

---------

**5. TOWER ACOUSTICS AND HABITABILITY**

*\[NEW --- V2.2\]*

**5.1 The Aerogel Tower as Wind Instrument**

*\[NEW --- V2.2 --- full structural treatment in
substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx Section 5\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** The tower lattice is a mineral aerogel --- a foam of
semiconductor deposited at nano- to microscale. Mostly void by volume.
Enormous internal surface area. Strong in compression. Light enough that
kilometer-tall columns are feasible in 1.82g precisely because they are
mostly air. Gas diffuses through the matrix. The whole tower is a lung
and a solar panel simultaneously, at every point. The overall shape is a
rounded, slightly tapering pillar --- a truncated cone, nearly circular
in cross-section, dome-topped. From a distance it looks geological: a
butte or sea stack.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Wind flowing through the porous aerogel matrix excites
resonances at every scale. Different void sizes, different channel
lengths, different resonant frequencies. Every tower is a pipe organ.
The tower does not produce white noise --- it produces a specific,
complex, structured chord determined by its geometry. Every tower has a
unique voice. The voice changes as the tower erodes and accretes --- a
real-time acoustic readout of the tower's physical state.

At the terminator (50--80 m/s wind), the acoustic output is enormous.
The sound propagates through the aerogel matrix and radiates from every
surface. The leeward side of a terminator tower is sheltered from wind
but not from sound --- it may be louder than the windward side in
certain frequencies because the material acts as a waveguide.

The speed of sound in this atmosphere is 733 m/s. The acoustic
properties of the aerogel matrix differ from those of the air in its
voids. Waveguide effects and frequency filtering produce structured,
complex sound --- not simple roaring.

**5.2 Acoustic Threat Model: Resonance, Not Volume**

*\[REVISED --- V2.2\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** Acoustic danger to amorphs is not about volume or
pressure intensity per se. An amorph is a fluid-bodied organism with no
rigid sensory apparatus like eardrums. Pressure waves at most
frequencies pass through the body without disruption --- the organism is
acoustically transparent, a bag of fluid in a fluid medium. The danger
is resonance. Every physical structure in the amorph --- boundary
membrane, internal compartments, molecular scaffolding, signaling
architectures --- has natural resonant frequencies determined by its
size, tension, and material properties. When an external acoustic
frequency matches a resonant mode, that structure absorbs energy.
Amplitude builds. The structure oscillates with increasing violence. The
chemistry operating inside that structure cannot complete because the
substrate is bouncing.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Every amorph has different resonant frequencies.
Different body size, different membrane tension, different internal
geometry. A frequency lethal to one organism is transparent to another.
Acoustic danger is specific, not general.

The tower's output is a dense thicket of simultaneous frequencies ---
every pore size, every channel length, every void geometry contributing
its own resonant note. Thousands of frequencies simultaneously. The
tower is a sonic shotgun. Most frequencies pass harmlessly through any
given organism. But with enough frequencies in the chord, something will
match somebody. A megafauna amorph standing in the lee of a terminator
tower is being washed with thousands of frequencies. If one happens to
match the resonant mode of its boundary membrane or an internal
compartment, that frequency is pumping energy into that structure
continuously. The tower never stops singing. The wind never stops
blowing.

Amorphs can defend themselves: variable morphology allows them to shift
membrane tension, resize compartments, redistribute mass. Detune
themselves from the dangerous frequency. This is not instantaneous ---
molecular reorganization takes time --- but it is possible. Megafauna
amorphs in high-acoustic environments are probably doing this
constantly. Active acoustic self-tuning. Continuously deforming to avoid
resonance with the local tower chord. This is a cognitive load:
terminator amorphs are always partly distracted by the need to not
resonate.

**⚠ NOTE:** Critical revision: megafauna amorphs (including Collectors)
are too large to live inside the tower's aerogel lattice. They live on
the ground, around and between towers. The towers are landscape
features, not homes. The acoustic environment that matters for megafauna
is not 'inside the lattice' but 'in the lee of the tower,' where the
aerogel has filtered the raw wind-noise into the tower's specific
structured chord. The leeward acoustic environment is survivable --- not
because it is quiet, but because the aerogel filtering has removed or
attenuated many frequencies, leaving a sparser chord with fewer
resonance matches for any given organism.

**5.3 The Dark-Side Singing Towers**

On the dark side, wind is gentle (5--15 m/s). The same aerogel resonance
that produces lethal acoustic intensity at the terminator produces
something else here: music. The towers sing quietly. The sound is
structured, complex, harmonically rich, and unique to each tower. The
dark-side singing towers were already established in earlier documents;
the aerogel structure now provides the mechanism.

Monks chose the dark side for its quiet. The singing is quiet enough not
to disrupt chemistry --- it is ambient, omnipresent, part of the sensory
environment of contemplation. The monks don't meditate in silence. They
meditate in a chord shaped by the tower's entire physical structure, a
sound that changes as the tower changes.

---------

**6. THE ACOUSTIC PREDATORS**

*\[NEW --- V2.2, REVISED V2.2, REVISED V2.4\]*

**6.1 The Subwoofer — Overview**

**✓ RESOLVED:** A predator lineage that weaponizes targeted acoustic
resonance to destroy amorph body structures at range. Does not need to
touch the prey. Does not use fluorine, does not fire penetrators. It
vibrates a membrane at frequencies tuned to match the resonant modes of
the prey's physical structures --- boundary membrane, internal
compartments, molecular scaffolding. The targeted structure absorbs
energy, oscillates with increasing amplitude, and the chemistry
operating inside it fails.

The kill is not brute-force infrasound. It is precision frequency
targeting. The predator finds the specific frequency that makes a
specific structure in the prey resonate, then drives it until the
structure fails or the chemistry it supports is disrupted beyond
recovery.

**6.2 Body Plan and Scale**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Middle-kingdom, not amorph. Rigid-bodied, solid-state
semiconductor. Cognitive processing runs in crystal lattice, not fluid
molecular chemistry. Sound waves that resonate with amorph fluid
structures pass through a rigid lattice without effect --- the predator
is acoustically immune because its cognition is hardware, not wetware.

**Scale:** 10–30 cm body length (large for middle-kingdom). The membrane
must produce frequencies in the 10–200 Hz range to target megafauna
amorph resonances (body sizes 0.1–2+ m). At 8 bar atmospheric density,
acoustic coupling is extremely efficient — a 10 cm membrane driven by
50 m/s wind projects significant acoustic power. The body is compact,
low-profile, dense (SiC crystal lattice). Locomotion: ambulatory, low
to the ground, multiple limbs providing stable platform for membrane
orientation. The organism looks geological — a small dark ridge on the
substrate, unremarkable until the membrane deploys.

**The membrane** is the weapon. A taut vibrating surface, tunable across
a frequency range by varying tension and effective diameter. At the
terminator, the membrane functions as a sail --- the 50 m/s wind
provides the energy. The organism does not generate the vibration from
metabolic reserves. It tunes the resonant frequency of a wind-driven
membrane. Metabolic cost: low. The wind does the work. The membrane is
dorsal — the organism faces into the wind, membrane angled to catch
airflow, body anchored to the substrate.

**Acoustic immunity:** The subwoofer's own body does not resonate
destructively at frequencies that destroy amorphs. Its crystal lattice
has resonant modes at much higher frequencies (kHz range, set by the
lattice geometry at micro- to millimeter scale). Amorph-killing
frequencies pass through without coupling. The predator is transparent
to its own weapon.

**6.3 Acoustic Return Sensing**

*\[NEW --- V2.2\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** The subwoofer can hear when it has found the prey's
resonant frequency. Its rigid crystal lattice is a superb acoustic
sensor --- piezoelectric, converting pressure waves directly to
electrical signal. When the predator's emitted frequency matches a
resonant mode of the prey, the prey's structure begins to oscillate and
radiates acoustic energy back. The prey lights up acoustically --- it
becomes a secondary source, ringing at the driving frequency. The
acoustic return from a resonating target is louder and more structured
than the return from a non-resonating one. The subwoofer hears the
moment it finds the match.

This is sonar in reverse: instead of listening for echoes of a ping,
the subwoofer listens for the prey to start *singing back* at the
driving frequency. A non-resonating target scatters the signal. A
resonating target amplifies and re-emits it. The distinction is
unambiguous.

**6.4 The Frequency Chase**

*\[NEW --- V2.2\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** The prey's defense is to reconfigure. Amorphs can shift
membrane tension, resize compartments, redistribute mass --- detune away
from the driving frequency. The resonant peak slides. The acoustic
return dims. The subwoofer tracks it --- adjusts its membrane, sweeps to
follow the shifting resonance. The hunt is a pursuit in frequency space,
not just physical space.

The subwoofer has the advantage. Tuning a wind-driven membrane is fast
--- mechanical, direct, simple. Reconfiguring amorph body geometry is
slow --- molecular reorganization, chemistry, redistribution of mass.
The predator can retune faster than the prey can reshape.

The prey's frequency dodging grows more desperate, more radical. Larger
deformations. Compartments collapsing and reforming. Internal
architecture scrambling. Each reconfiguration disrupts whatever
cognitive processes were using those structures. The prey is tearing
apart its own thinking to escape a frequency it cannot outrun. By the
time the predator feeds, the prey has done half the work itself --- its
internal organization is in chaos from its own evasive restructuring.

**6.5 Pack Hunting: Multi-Frequency Targeting**

*\[REVISED --- V2.2\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** A pack of subwoofers phase-locks its emissions for
amplitude (constructive interference, standing waves, pressure antinodes
--- the original model). But there is a second, more devastating layer:
each pack member can target a different resonant mode of the same prey
simultaneously. One drives the boundary membrane. Another finds an
internal compartment. A third catches whatever structure the prey just
reconfigured into while dodging the first two.

The prey cannot detune from all of them simultaneously. Every escape
from one frequency is a blunder into another. The pack does not need to
coordinate this deliberately. Each individual independently sweeps,
independently listens for acoustic return, independently locks onto
whatever resonance it finds. They converge on the prey's body from
multiple directions in frequency space by simple individual
optimization, the same way they converge in physical space.

A single subwoofer is a threat you can potentially outrun in frequency
space. A coordinated pack is a kill volume in both physical space and
frequency space. There is no direction to flee and no frequency to hide
in.

**Pack size:** [REVISED V2.4] Typically 10–25 individuals. The pack
operates as a **distributed phased-array weapon system.** Each member is
naturally a different size (10–30 cm range within a single pack),
producing a different frequency range. The pack's aggregate capability
scales nonlinearly:

- **Power:** Coherent addition. N phase-locked emitters deliver N² power
  at the focal point, not N. A pack of 20 delivers 400× a lone
  individual's power at the target. In 8-bar atmosphere, this is
  catastrophic.
- **Bandwidth:** Size diversity across the pack means simultaneous
  coverage across a wide frequency band. The target amorph cannot
  detune against one frequency without exposing vulnerability to
  another.
- **Spatial focusing:** Distributed emitters around the prey create a
  convergence zone — constructive interference at the target,
  destructive elsewhere. Precision improves with pack size and
  encirclement quality.

The primary constraint on pack size is acoustic sensing: each
individual must read its own acoustic returns through the combined
emissions of the entire pack. Larger packs produce more noise. The
coordination problem is solved by EM-synchronized phase-locking —
each member knows the exact timing and frequency of every other
member's emission and can filter them from its own returns.

**Pack coordination:** EM signaling for spatial coordination (bearing,
spacing, encirclement) AND phase synchronization (timing, frequency
assignment). Acoustic signaling is unavailable — the pack cannot
communicate by sound without contaminating its own targeting signals.
The EM channel handles all logistics and synchronization; the acoustic
channel is reserved entirely for the weapon.

**6.6 Thunder-Skin Interaction**

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The thunder-skin meme (Fauna Structural Hub §5.6) is the
prey's first line of defense — an ancient acoustic baffle (gas-pocket
sub-membrane layer + Helmholtz cavity surface texture) tuned to thunder
frequencies (20–500 Hz). One-step deployment, universal among amorphs,
billions of years old.

Thunder-skin is effective against broadband environmental acoustics
(thunder, tower chord). It is **not sufficient** against a subwoofer.
The difference:

- Thunder is broadband, transient, and unsustained. Thunder-skin sheds
  the energy by breaking the impedance match across a wide band. Good
  enough.
- A subwoofer is narrowband, sustained, and adaptive. It searches for
  the specific frequency where the baffle has a gap — every Helmholtz
  cavity has a finite bandwidth, and no practical baffle covers the
  entire 10–200 Hz range without gaps. The subwoofer finds the gap and
  holds it. Thunder-skin buys time but does not solve the problem.

**The evolutionary arms race:** Subwoofers drove thunder-skin to become
more sophisticated. Ancient thunder-skin was simple — a few cavity sizes
covering the dominant thunder frequencies. Subwoofer predation selected
for broader coverage, more cavity sizes, adaptive retuning capability.
The subwoofer, in turn, evolved faster sweep rates and finer frequency
resolution to find shrinking gaps. This is the oldest acoustic arms race
on the planet — predating tool use, predating civilization, predating
the Collector lineage.

**The subwoofer already frequency-hops.** Each sweep across the prey's
resonant spectrum is a frequency-hopping attack — the predator doesn't
stay on one frequency, it continuously searches and re-searches as the
prey retunes. Pack hunting is multi-frequency-hopping: N simultaneous
independent sweeps. This means amorphs evolved countermeasures against
frequency-hopping billions of years before warfare existed. The
"advanced" acoustic weapons in the Warfare Hub (§3.5, gen 2–3) are
reinventions of a natural predation strategy the prey has already been
adapting to since before the Collectors existed. (Warfare Hub §3.5.)

**6.7 Feeding**

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The subwoofer does not consume the entire prey. Once
resonance-driven structural failure reduces the amorph to a
disorganized gel mass, the subwoofer moves in and feeds on the surface
layer — dissolving accessible chemistry through contact secretions and
absorbing nutrients through ventral surface transport. Feeding is slow
relative to the kill. A pack may spend hours processing a single
megafauna kill, each member working a different section of the remains.

The subwoofer cannot absorb memes, keys, or molecular library content.
It is middle-kingdom — rigid crystal lattice, genomic reproduction. The
prey's knowledge dies unconsumed. Whatever the subwoofer doesn't eat
degrades on the substrate. If other amorphs arrive in time, they can
potentially salvage fragments from the unconsumed portions — but the
structural disruption from resonance is severe, and most organized
molecular content is already scrambled by the time feeding begins.

**6.8 Reproduction and Social Structure**

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Sexual reproduction (middle-kingdom, genomic, free-living
size regime — see Fauna Structural Hub §7). Pack structure is
semi-permanent — extended family groups of 10–25 related individuals.
Juveniles develop within the pack, learning frequency-sweep patterns and
prey-reading skills through direct observation, not meme transfer. Each
generation learns from scratch — no inherited hunting memes, just
inherited neural architecture optimized by millions of years of
selection for fast frequency discrimination.

Pack territories are loosely defined by acoustic range — a pack claims a
stretch of transition zone or a particular tower-lee corridor. Lone
subwoofers occasionally split from packs and either join other packs or
hunt solo (lower success rate, limited to small or already-injured
prey).

**6.9 Habitat and Distribution**

*\[REVISED --- V2.2, REVISED V2.4\]*

**Primary habitat: terminator transition zone.** The subwoofer's prey is
megafauna amorphs, which are too large to shelter inside the tower
lattice. They live on the ground, around and between towers. At the deep
terminator (80 m/s), the ambient acoustic environment is so dense with
frequencies that megafauna amorphs cannot operate above ground at all
--- no prey to hunt. The subwoofer's hunting ground is the day-side
shoulder of the terminator: the transition zone where wind drops from
lethal to merely brutal (30–50 m/s). Still enough wind to power the
membrane weapon. And the prey is already acoustically stressed ---
devoting cognitive resources to continuous self-tuning against the
ambient tower chord. The subwoofer does not need to overpower the prey
from scratch. It just needs to push an already-stressed organism over
the edge the ambient environment has brought it to.

**✓ RESOLVED: Preferred hunting ground is the leeward acoustic shadow.**
The lee of towers offers a sparser, more structured acoustic environment
— the tower chord is filtered through the lattice, leaving clear
frequency windows the subwoofer can operate in without broadband
masking. The gaps between towers have direct wind and broadband noise
that degrades the predator's targeting precision. The lee is where the
prey goes for shelter — and the predator follows. The tower's acoustic
shadow is simultaneously refuge and trap.

**✓ RESOLVED: Day-side variants exist.** Reduced, metabolically powered
subwoofers inhabit the day-side deposition zone and volcanic provinces.
Smaller (5–15 cm), shorter range, slower retune rate. They pay for
membrane vibration from metabolic reserves rather than wind — higher
energy cost, lower sustained output. In volcanic provinces, thermal
convection from vent activity supplements metabolic power (warm updrafts
drive the membrane). Day-side variants hunt in smaller packs (5–10) and
target smaller or already-compromised prey. Less dangerous than
terminator packs but still lethal to a lone amorph, especially one
already stressed by petrification, heat, or the cumulative tax of
day-side survival. The principle is the same; the power budget is
tighter.

Day-side subwoofers are rarer and less studied (by amorphs) than
terminator populations. Daysider amorphs know them as a hazard of open
terrain — one more reason to travel in groups, stay near cover, and
avoid isolation in the volcanic provinces.

**6.10 Evolutionary Origin**

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The subwoofer lineage originates from middle-kingdom
tower fauna. The ancestral organism was a sessile or semi-mobile
lattice-dweller with a membrane organ used for territorial acoustic
signaling — vibrating to claim space within the tower's internal
ecology. At insect scale, inside the lattice, acoustic signaling is
common (the tower's internal acoustic environment is structured and
relatively calm compared to the exterior).

The transition to predation occurred when the organism moved to the
tower exterior — the windward surface, where wind-driven membrane
vibration produced far more acoustic power than metabolic vibration ever
could. At the exterior, the organism's acoustic output began to
interact with the much larger amorph megafauna living around the tower
base. Chance resonance with prey structures produced distress responses
— injured or disoriented prey is easy scavenging for any organism that
can reach the remains.

Selection favored: larger membrane area, tunable frequency, ambulatory
capability (to approach distressed prey), and eventually active
frequency-sweep behavior (searching for resonance rather than producing
it by accident). The transition from "organism that happens to make a
noise that sometimes bothers amorphs" to "precision frequency-targeting
predator" was gradual, driven by the enormous caloric payoff of
megafauna prey relative to the subwoofer's small body mass.

The middle-kingdom railgun predators (§2.2) followed a different
evolutionary path — miniaturized kinetic weapons for tower-internal
hunting. The subwoofer lineage weaponized acoustics for exterior,
cross-scale predation. Both are middle-kingdom predators; they share a
deep ancestry but diverged early.

**6.11 Implications for Amorph Behavior**

*\[REVISED V2.4\]*

The acoustic predator makes the terminator transition zone the most
dangerous place on the planet for megafauna amorphs. Wind, lightning,
ambient resonance hazard from the tower chord, and predators that
can find and chase your body's resonant frequencies. Every defense costs
cognitive capacity: self-tuning against the ambient chord is a constant
background tax, and fleeing a subwoofer's targeting in frequency space
means dismantling your own internal organization.

This is powerful reinforcement of cautious behavior in the transition
zone. Megafauna amorphs crossing the terminator region move quickly,
stay in the acoustic shadow of towers, travel in groups (a subwoofer
targeting one individual in a group of differently-sized amorphs with
different resonant frequencies must split its phased-array focus and
cannot deliver full N² power to all targets simultaneously).
**Group travel is acoustic defense.** Size diversity within a group is an
advantage — even a 20-member pack cannot efficiently phase-lock on both
a 2-meter Collector and a 0.3-meter juvenile simultaneously, because
their resonant spectra barely overlap. The pack must choose a target or
split focus, reducing coherent power on each.

On the day side, the same behavioral pressures apply at lower intensity.
Daysider amorphs avoid open ground in the volcanic provinces. Trade
caravans and hunting parties travel in groups. Lone individuals are
vulnerable — and the subwoofer packs know it.

**⚠ NOTE:** Three unanswerable attack vectors for a terminator-zone
amorph: fluorine (chemical --- your flesh becomes gas), acoustic
resonance (physical --- your structures tear themselves apart), and
environment (wind, lightning). No single defense covers all three. Armor
helps against fluorine and wind. Morphological flexibility helps against
acoustics. Nothing helps against lightning except not being the tallest
thing on the ground. The Collectors are the only lineage desperate and
creative enough to find solutions. Tool use is the consolation prize for
organisms that cannot win by any biological means.

**6.12 Domesticated Subwoofers: Industrial Applications**

*[NEW V2.4]*

Wild subwoofers are precision acoustic weapons that self-tune to target
resonant frequencies in real time. Domesticated subwoofers are the same
thing pointed at something useful. Breeding programs select for
docility, frequency range, power output, and targeting obedience (responding
to handler EM commands rather than hunting autonomously). The organism's
existing EM-coordination circuitry (§6.8) provides the interface —
a trained subwoofer responds to handler signals the way a wild one
responds to pack-mates.

**Applications by domain:**

| Domain | Application | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **Non-destructive testing** | Structural inspection of tower lattice, SiC components, sealed vessels | Subwoofer sweeps frequency range across a structure. Handler listens for anomalous resonance signatures — cracks, voids, delamination, fatigue zones. Faster and more sensitive than any manufactured transducer because the organism self-adjusts in real time. |
| **Acoustic machining** | Precision cutting, drilling, surface finishing of SiC and ceramic workpieces | Sustained resonance at a workpiece's natural frequency induces controlled fracture along crystal planes. Finer than mechanical tooling for brittle ceramics. The subwoofer *is* the CNC head. |
| **Cleaning / degassing** | Industrial cleaning of lattice chambers, removal of silazane fouling, degassing of liquid ammonia feedstocks | Ultrasonic cavitation in liquid ammonia. Same physics as Earth's ultrasonic cleaning baths, but the "transducer" is a living organism that adjusts power and frequency to the job. |
| **Mining** | Resonance-fracturing of rock faces, ore liberation | Multiple subwoofers targeting the same rock face at coordinated frequencies. Controlled fracture propagation without explosive charges. Especially valuable in deep-root mining (Miner guild, §8) where vibration control matters. |
| **Communication** | Long-range acoustic signaling, relay networks | Subwoofers' 20+ meter effective range (§6.2) through 8-bar atmosphere is useful for point-to-point acoustic messaging in environments where EM is noisy or attenuated (deep interior, storm conditions). Bred for signal clarity over destructive power. |
| **Medicine** | Targeted acoustic disruption of pathological structures | Precision frequency targeting of petrification deposits (Geology Hub §6), parasitic inclusions, or malformed tissue. The biological equivalent of lithotripsy. Requires the most highly trained animals and handlers. |
| **Sono-chemistry** | Acoustic cavitation as industrial process driver | Cavitation-driven chemistry in ammonia or other process liquids. Focused acoustic energy creates localized extreme conditions (temperature, pressure) at the cavitation site. |
| **Research: sono-fusion** | The garage experiment | A subwoofer aimed at a flask of deuterium-enriched ammonia. 8-bar ambient pressure means cavitation collapse is violent. If sono-fusion is real, this is how it gets discovered — not by a physicist designing an experiment, but by an industrial chemist noticing anomalous neutron flux from a subwoofer-driven process vessel. (Heavy Industry Hub §12.6) |

**Breeding and husbandry:** Domesticated subwoofers retain their
semi-permanent extended family structure (§6.8). Handlers work with
family groups of 5–15 individuals, not isolated animals. A lone
domesticated subwoofer is stressed and unreliable. Industrial
applications exploit the pack's natural phased-array capability —
multiple subwoofers targeting the same workpiece deliver N² power
at the focal point. The breeding stock is sexually
reproducing (like all subwoofers), so selective breeding follows
standard genetics — no meme-key complications.

**Scale:** Domesticated lines tend toward the larger end of the wild
range (20–30 cm) for industrial applications, or toward smaller,
higher-frequency individuals (8–15 cm) for precision work and medical
applications. Day-side variants (§6.9) — already metabolically
powered rather than wind-driven — are preferred for indoor work
where ambient wind is unavailable.

**Economic note:** Subwoofer handlers are a recognized specialist
trade. The animals are valuable, training is slow, and a well-bonded
handler–pack team is not easily replaceable. This mirrors Earth's
working-dog traditions — the tool is alive, opinionated, and takes
years to train.

**7. THE COLLECTORS: WHY TOOL USE EVOLVES ONCE**

*\[NEW --- V2.2\]*

**7.1 Weakness as Selection Pressure**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tool use evolves exactly once on this planet, in the
Collector lineage. Not because amorphs are the only organisms with
manipulable bodies, but because the Collectors are weak. They are
generalist scavengers, not apex competitors. They lose on every physical
axis --- size, chemical weaponry, armor, speed. They need a force
multiplier. The analogy is primate: apes evolved hands for brachiation,
were forced from the trees by climate change, and repurposed their
sophisticated ballistics-modeling brains for tool use under pressure.

The Collectors' equivalent: they inherit spatial and environmental
models through merge (generations of navigating tower lattice geometry,
manipulating their own bodies through complex 3D spaces, interacting
with loose objects). This gives them the prerequisite --- the ability to
mentally simulate "if I push this, it goes there." Other amorph lineages
have merge and inherited experience, but they are not under selection
pressure to repurpose their cognitive architecture for object
manipulation. They are winning by other means.

**7.2 Cooperation and Theory of Mind**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Weakness drives cooperation. A single Collector is food.
A pack of Collectors is a force. Pack hunting requires theory of mind
--- modeling not just the environment but the other minds in the pack.
"If I go left, she goes right, and the target runs toward him" requires
three simultaneous mental models.

Merge makes this eerily effective. A Collector doesn't just model other
minds abstractly. It has been other minds. It carries the experiential
memory of predecessors who occupied every position in the formation. A
young Collector steps into a pack and already knows what every role
feels like from the inside.

The sequence: weakness → cooperation → theory of mind → environmental
modeling → tool use. Merge accelerates the entire sequence by orders of
magnitude compared to any genomic-inheritance species.

**7.3 Intelligence as Consolation Prize**

Every other lineage on the planet is either winning without intelligence
(skywhales, apex predators, fluorine-armed organisms) or computationally
sophisticated but unconscious (the tower network, the middle kingdom,
possibly the skywhales). The Collectors are the freaks. The only
tool-users. Intelligence evolved here not as a crown of creation but as
the last resort of an organism that couldn't compete any other way.

---------

**8. PARASITES**

**8.1 Four Categories**

**Genomic fragments:** selfish genetic elements. Junk files in the
molecular library. Replicate within the library without contributing to
the organism's function. The equivalent of transposons.

**Boundary infiltrators:** mimic host surface chemistry to penetrate the
boundary membrane. Breach the organism's physical perimeter.

**Signal parasites:** EM-emitting organisms that steer host behavior.
The Toxoplasma analog. An organism that broadcasts signals mimicking the
tower network's management signals, hijacking the host's tropistic
responses. The host believes it is following a legitimate signal. It is
being steered.

**Autocatalytic hijackers:** viral analog. Minimal reaction networks
that co-opt host metabolism. The smallest possible parasite --- a recipe
that borrows someone else's kitchen.

**□ OPEN:** Signal parasite lifecycle and epidemic dynamics. How does a
signal parasite reproduce? Does it have a latent phase? Can it be
transmitted through merge (terrifying implications for amorph
cognition)?

**8.2 Decomposers**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Enzymatically cleave Si-Si bonds. Attack
slow-metabolizing tissue. Sleep requires keep-alive signals --- an
amorph that stops broadcasting its chemical "I'm alive" signal is
consumed by decomposers. There is no rest without vigilance. Sleep must
be partial, maintaining active perimeter defense, or it is death.

---------

**9. DISPERSAL AND THE LEEWARD DROP**

**9.1 Windborne Dispersal: Particles, Not Surfers**

*\[REVISED --- V2.2\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** Windborne dispersal between towers is real but operates
on small organisms only. An organism embedded in the airstream is not
surfing --- there is no boundary to ride. It is a particle. It goes
where the wind takes it at the wind's speed. Small organisms
(middle-kingdom dispersal morphs, microbial amorphs, spores, fragments)
have favorable surface-to-mass ratio: air resistance decelerates them
quickly once they enter a tower's wind shadow, and they land survivably.
Large organisms have the momentum. At 60 m/s into a mineral pillar, they
do not survive.

**⚠ NOTE:** The earlier 'wind-surfing' model described organisms riding
the airstream with control surfaces. This is incorrect --- an organism
embedded in the medium cannot surf. Control surfaces can adjust attitude
and spin but cannot change velocity relative to the freestream.
Maneuvering is limited to minor trajectory adjustments during the
deceleration phase inside a tower's wind shadow. The term 'surfing' is
retained in amorph cultural memory as a metaphor, not a description of
physics.

**9.2 The Leeward Drop**

*\[NEW --- V2.2\]*

**✓ RESOLVED:** An amorph that needs to leave a terminator tower goes
off the leeward face. The leeward wind shadow is the one place where
airflow drops to near-zero. The organism steps off into still air and
falls. Straight down. In 1.82g.

Survival toolkit: spread flat to maximize drag and reduce terminal
velocity. Deploy hydrogen bladders --- not for buoyancy (insufficient
volume in a non-balloon organism) but as braking charges. Each popped
bladder expands gas outward, momentarily increasing effective
cross-section. A rapid sequence of pops is a biological airbrake.
Emergency bladders may be maintained specifically for this purpose in
terminator-dwelling lineages.

At mouse-to-lizard scale, a few hydrogen bladders and a spread body may
reduce terminal velocity to something survivable. At larger scales, the
square-cube law makes this increasingly desperate. The leeward drop is
routine for small amorphs and a gamble for larger ones.

**✓ RESOLVED:** In amorph lineages, fall-survival technique is
inheritable through merge. An amorph's predecessors survived this fall;
it carries the memory of how they configured their bodies on the way
down, which bladders to pop in what sequence, when to spread and when to
ball up for impact. First fall, practiced landing.

**9.3 The Transition Zone Refugees**

*\[NEW --- V2.2\]*

The leeward drop creates a steady trickle of megafauna amorphs at the
base of terminator towers. They jumped, fell, or were pushed. They
survived the landing. They are on the ground in the lee. They cannot
climb back up easily. They cannot walk into the wind --- it is 80 m/s.
They can only go day-ward.

Movement through the transition zone is shadow-hopping: staying in the
wind shadow of one tower, then crossing the gap to the next tower's wind
shadow. Day-ward, always day-ward. The wind pushes everything that
direction. The tower shadows provide stepping stones of calm air through
the gale.

The gaps between shadows are the killing ground. Exposed to the full
acoustic output of the nearest towers. Stressed by the ambient chord.
And the subwoofers hunt the lee corridors (see Section 6.9). The
terminator transition zone is a refugee highway and the subwoofers are
the bandits.

This prey population is small in number but steady over geological time.
The subwoofers do not need a large prey base. They are wind-powered with
low metabolic overhead. They can afford to wait.

**9.4 The Tower-Death Exodus**

**✓ RESOLVED:** When a tower dies, the mobile minority of its fauna
launch en masse from the leeward face. Millions of small organisms
streaming into the wind. The sessile majority dies in place, silently.

Small fauna detect the failing energy grid before anyone else --- they
have no reserves, they feel the current drop first. The amorphs learn to
read the sign: a streaming ribbon of millions of small organisms peeling
off the leeward face means the tower is dying.

During the atmospheric crisis, tower-death cascades propagate downwind.
Tower A dies, refugees overload Tower B's stressed ecology, B declines,
B's refugees flee to C. A domino wave of collapse visible as sequential
clouds of small organisms, approaching from the terminator direction.
But this visible cascade is the symptom; the deeper cause is the
network's self-destructive healing response propagating through the root
infrastructure (see substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx, Section: Cascade
Failure).

---------

**10. REGIONAL ECOLOGIES**

**10.1 Terminator**

Maximum energy (wind + lightning + marginal solar). Maximum danger
(acoustic assault, wind exposure, fluorine predators in volcanic zones,
the subwoofer). Highest turnover --- everything is new because nothing
stays long. The biological factory of the planet: organisms are produced
here and dispersed day-ward by the wind. The richest chemistry
(lightning-produced organosilicon compounds) above the most lethal
conditions.

**10.2 Deposition Zone**

Highest biodiversity. Billions of years of wind-delivered and
balloon-delivered biology from every other region. The richest tower
fauna --- the most species, the most complex food webs, the deepest
ecological history. Moderate conditions: enough wind for piezoelectric
harvest, enough starlight for photovoltaics, abundant mineral from the
particulate stream. The capital is ecologically as well as
computationally supreme.

**10.3 Dark Side**

Sparse. Cold. Calm. Slow. The gentlest conditions and the least energy.
Tower fauna are fewer species, lower biomass, slower metabolism. The
singing towers are the dominant sensory feature. Monks and
contemplatives are the primary civilized inhabitants. Ecologically
simple; cognitively important.

**10.4 Day Side (Deep)**

Hot. Still. Solar-dominated. The parabolic-dish solar towers (see
substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx) support their own ecology, but it is
energy-constrained in a different way --- abundant light energy, minimal
wind, no particulate supply (the deposition zone captured everything).
Tower fauna here are solar-adapted: metabolism tuned to photovoltaic
energy, possibly more sessile and less mobile than terminator
equivalents.

**10.5 Volcanic Provinces**

Ecologically alien. The fluorine biome dominates (Section 4). Day-side
volcanic provinces are the source of fluorine, of metal ores, of the
geological activity that replenishes atmospheric silane. Dangerous,
valuable, culturally distinct. The organisms here are armed. The amorphs
who live here are specialists --- fluorine-thorn harvesters, metal
traders, danger-culture communities.

**10.6 Anti-Stellar Pole**

Near-zero wind. Near-zero light. Towers are immobile, sitting in the
wind stagnation zone. The most isolated, slowest, quietest ecology on
the planet. What lives here has lived here for a very long time and has
nowhere to go. Potential deep-time refugia for ancient lineages.

---------

**OPEN QUESTIONS**

**□ OPEN:** Middle-kingdom taxonomy: how many phyla? What body plans?
What genomic architecture?

**□ OPEN:** The gradient zones between amorph and genomic life: what
does the boundary look like? Are there intermediate organisms?

**□ OPEN:** Tower-locked middle kingdom: do any exceptions exist?
Metabolically independent genomic organisms that can survive between
towers?

**✓ RESOLVED:** Acoustic predator distribution: day-side variants exist.
Metabolically powered, smaller, shorter range. Volcanic provinces have
thermal convection supplement. See §6.9. [RESOLVED V2.4]

**✓ RESOLVED:** Subwoofer hunting ground: leeward acoustic shadow
preferred. Sparser frequencies for precision targeting. Prey shelters
there — predator follows. See §6.9. [RESOLVED V2.4]

**□ OPEN:** Acoustic ecology of the aerogel tower: what middle-kingdom
organisms exploit or are adapted to the tower's acoustic output? Sound
as ecological niche. Are there organisms that have tuned their body
structures to resonate with the tower's chord deliberately --- using the
tower's acoustic output as a free energy source?

**□ OPEN:** Amorph acoustic self-tuning: how much cognitive load? Does
it impair other functions noticeably? Is there an amorph lineage that
has evolved fixed body geometry (sacrificing morphological flexibility)
in exchange for a predictable, easily-managed set of resonant
frequencies?

**✓ RESOLVED:** Group travel as acoustic defense: size diversity within
a group is an advantage — a pack cannot efficiently target both a
2-meter Collector and a 0.3-meter juvenile simultaneously. Selection
pressure for size diversity within traveling groups (not necessarily
within Collector communities specifically — any mixed-size group
benefits). See §6.11. [RESOLVED V2.4]

**□ OPEN:** Fluorine-adapted lineages in detail: specific organisms and
their ecologies.

**□ OPEN:** Fluorine biomagnification: apex predators of volcanic
provinces. How dangerous? How large?

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine-thorn flora can be cultivated in the deposition zone with fluoride-enriched substrate. The plant already has the full biochemistry for CaF₂ thorn production; it needs only CaF₂ supply. Volcanic HF fallout provides natural enrichment in the deposition zone. Deliberate enrichment (carrying fluorite from vent zones, grinding into soil) extends range further. This enables agricultural-scale fluorine ammunition production — a weapons crop. Tool-using amorphs ("Effectors") reverse-engineer the viper railgun via merge, farm the thorn-plants for ammunition. Pre-industrial fluorine weapon. [RESOLVED V2.4]

**□ OPEN:** Signal parasite lifecycle and epidemic dynamics.
Transmission through merge?

**□ OPEN:** Decomposer ecology: what keeps decomposers in check when the
organism is alive? How fast do they consume a dead tower?

**□ OPEN:** Microbiology in general. Immune system details. Fragment
exchange protocols.

**□ OPEN:** Aerial soaring lineage: reproduction, predation, ecology of
the atmospheric conveyor (cross-reference balloon hub).

**□ OPEN:** The specific organosilicon compounds produced by terminator
lightning. Plasma chemistry question with a potentially computable
answer.

**□ OPEN:** Lightning as ongoing abiogenesis. Pre-living autocatalytic
chemistry held in check by ecological competition?

**□ OPEN:** Anti-stellar pole ecology: what ancient lineages survive
there? How different from the rest of the biosphere?

---------

**SUMMARY: RESOLVED ITEMS**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Three-tier life architecture: microbial amorph /
middle-kingdom genomic-sexual / megafauna amorph. Physically motivated
by scale.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Middle kingdom is tower-locked electrical mutualists.
Small, rigid, genomic. Tap lattice for energy. Cannot self-power.
Network manages via tropism. Provide surface maintenance (Healers), metal delivery (Miners), quality control (Guards).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Sessile majority: 95%+ biomass. Mobile minority:
grazers, predators, dispersal morphs, logistics ants.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Grazers: Voronoi-armored SiC. Predators: railgun SiC
penetrators, real-time structural analysis of prey armor.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Logistics ants: middle-kingdom organisms following EM
pheromone gradients. One adaptation serving all tower lifecycle phases.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine biochemistry: entire adaptive radiation around
volcanic provinces. Fluorine attacks Si-Si bonds (SiF₄ volatilization).
Thorn-flora, pollinators, biomagnification, aposematic EM signatures.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Aerogel tower structure: mineral foam, mostly void,
enormous internal surface area. Strong in compression, light enough for
1.82g kilometer-scale columns. Every tower is a wind instrument.
Cross-section elongated in wind direction (see
substrate_tower_lifecycle.docx).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Acoustic threat is resonance, not volume. Amorphs are
acoustically transparent at most frequencies. Danger is when a frequency
matches a resonant mode of a body structure --- membrane, compartment,
scaffolding. That structure absorbs energy and oscillates destructively.
Every amorph has different resonant frequencies. The tower's chord is a
sonic shotgun --- thousands of simultaneous frequencies, some of which
will match somebody.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Megafauna amorphs (including Collectors) are too large
to live inside the tower lattice. They live on the ground, around and
between towers. Active acoustic self-tuning: amorphs continuously deform
to avoid resonating with the local tower chord. Cognitive load.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Acoustic predator (the subwoofer): middle-kingdom,
rigid-bodied (10–30 cm), wind-powered membrane weapon. Hunts by
frequency targeting — sweeps to find prey's resonant frequency, hears
acoustic return when resonance found (piezoelectric crystal lattice as
sensor), chases prey through frequency space as it retunes. Predator
retunes faster than prey can reshape. Acoustically immune to own weapon
(crystal lattice resonates at kHz, not prey-killing Hz).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Pack hunting (10–25 individuals): distributed phased-array
weapon system. Each member naturally different size → different frequency
range. Coherent addition: N phase-locked emitters deliver N² power at
focal point (20 emitters = 400× single). Prey cannot detune from all
frequencies simultaneously. EM for spatial coordination AND phase
synchronization; acoustic channel reserved for weapon. Semi-permanent
extended family packs, territorial.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Preferred hunting ground: leeward acoustic shadow of
towers. Sparser frequency environment for precision targeting. Prey
shelters there — predator follows.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Day-side variants exist. Smaller (5–15 cm),
metabolically powered, shorter range, smaller packs (5–10). Volcanic
provinces have thermal convection supplement. Less dangerous than
terminator packs but lethal to lone amorphs.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Thunder-skin buys time but is insufficient vs.
subwoofer. Subwoofer finds gaps in baffle bandwidth, holds frequency.
Subwoofer already frequency-hops (continuous sweep = ancient natural
frequency-hopping). Amorphs adapted to this billions of years before
warfare. Evolutionary origin: middle-kingdom tower fauna, acoustic
territorial signaling organ co-opted as weapon on tower exterior.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Collectors as sole tool-users: weakness → cooperation →
theory of mind → environmental modeling → tool use. Intelligence as
consolation prize. Merge accelerates the sequence.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Parasites: four categories (genomic fragments, boundary
infiltrators, signal parasites, autocatalytic hijackers). Decomposers
attack sleeping tissue --- sleep requires keep-alive signals.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Windborne dispersal is for small organisms only. An
organism embedded in the airstream is a particle, not a surfer. No
boundary to ride. Small organisms decelerate in tower wind shadows;
large organisms impact at wind speed.

**✓ RESOLVED:** The leeward drop: amorphs exit terminator towers by
stepping off the leeward face into the wind shadow. Survival by
spreading flat, popping hydrogen bladders as airbrakes. Fall technique
inherited through merge. Routine for mouse-to-lizard scale.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Transition zone refugees: leeward-drop survivors on the
ground, shadow-hopping day-ward between tower wind shadows. Steady prey
population for the subwoofer. Gaps between shadows are the killing
ground.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tower-death exodus: small mobile fauna stream from
leeward face when grid fails. Visible sign of total systems failure.
During crisis, cascades propagate downwind tower-to-tower.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Amorph size scaling: mobile megafauna are mouse-to-cat
scale. Large amorphs are root-locked --- can only travel along the
powered root network. The network controls where roots go, therefore
controls where large amorphs can travel.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Megafauna live on the ground around towers, not inside
the lattice. Towers are landscape features, not homes.
