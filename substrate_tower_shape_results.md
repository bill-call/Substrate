# Tower Cross-Section and Morphology — Results

**Session date:** February 2026
**Status:** Analysis document. Does not revise existing docs.

**Physics basis:** v2.4 atmospheric parameters. Aerogel self-recycling model. Pitting-only erosion at 9.5 m/s wind (self-repair completely negates). **Towers are stationary.** Shape determined by symbiote-directed biological construction and structural constraints, not erosion.

**Obsolete models resolved herein:** Sand-dune migration, sacrificial crust, subsurface living layer, wind-driven shattering of struts, marching/migrating towers. All are pre-v2.4 artifacts of a discarded high-wind environmental model. Wherever this document contradicts those models, this document is correct.

## 1. Summary of Derived Shape

**Cross-section (plan view):** Symmetric airfoil. Blunt convex windward face, maximum thickness at ~20-30% chord, tapering to narrow trailing edge with chimney vent openings. The windward face is a vaulted arch in the cross-wind direction (convex toward wind), providing structural efficiency via membrane compression.

**Vertical profile:** Tapered. Wide and deep at the base (structural buttress + root anchorage). Narrower and shallower with height. The top approaches a thin curved filter membrane — a broad ridge with a gentle central peak.

**Conceptual metaphor:** A vertical airfoil. Not a column. The tower is a thin curved wall, not a solid cylinder. "A thin membrane held up by an arch" (`_temp_tower_lifecycle.md` §5.4 V2.3).

**Regional continuum:** Airfoil (terminator, high wind) → teardrop (near dark side) → circular dome (anti-stellar, no wind). Shape is a continuous function of local wind speed.

## 2. Tower Construction Model

This section is foundational. The tower's shape cannot be understood without understanding how towers are built.

### 2.1 The tower has no genome

The tower is not an organism. It has no genes, no body plan, no construction blueprint. It cannot plan ahead. It responds to local, real-time measurements: compressive stress, wind force, material intake rate, electrical potential gradients. All it can control is what gets deposited (or destroyed) next, at its current exterior surface.

Once lattice is ceramified (SiC/SiCN), it is permanent. The tower cannot un-ceramify material. It CAN, however, destroy ceramified material using the same arc tool used for construction (see §2.4).

### 2.2 Growth phases over deep time

**Phase 1 — Autocatalytic mineral accretion.** Pre-symbiote. The proto-tower's N:SiC surface is catalytic. Lightning forges heavy molecules (PCS, complex organosilicon) from atmospheric SiH₄, CH₄, NH₃. Hypercyclic catalytic reactions on the tower surface assemble these into more lattice. The new surface is itself catalytic — the reaction front self-propagates. Growth follows the reaction front. The proto-tower is a mineral deposit shaped by physics: reactant flux (wind direction), energy input (lightning), and reaction geometry. No biology involved.

**Phase 2 — Symbiote colonization.** Aeroplankton reach the tower. Symbiotes tap grid power and process SiH₄ for their own metabolism. But the tower's bulk growth is still the catalytic reaction front. The symbiotes are tenants — and initially parasites from the tower's growth perspective, since they sit on the catalytic surface and consume SiH₄ that would otherwise feed the reaction.

**Phase 3 — Mutualism and the reef transition.** Miners deliver catalytic metals that accelerate the reaction. Healers evolve for surface repair (arc-CVD). But repair behaviors and construction behaviors are the same chemistry. A Healer that can patch a crack can extend a strut. Selection pressure via energy-gradient tropism: Healer lineages whose deposition patterns produce better tower architecture → better tower function → network feeds them more → those genomes spread. Over Gyr, Healer genomes accumulate architectural information that the tower itself cannot carry. The tower transitions from a mineral deposit shaped by physics to a biological construction shaped by symbiote genomes — a reef, a termite mound. The original autocatalytic reaction may be dead in modern towers, killed as a side effect of Healer construction (arc-CVD deposits non-catalytic SiCN over the original catalytic N:SiC surface).

### 2.3 The symbiote genome as tower construction program

The tower's "genome" is distributed across its symbiote species:

- **Healer genomes** encode: where to deposit, when to ceramify, what density to build, how to respond to local stress signals. Healers are both builders and demolition crews.
- **Miner genomes** encode: what metals to deliver where, how to distribute catalytic feedstock.
- **Guard genomes** encode: quality control — which Healer work gets tolerated, which gets stripped.
- **Network behavioral patterns** encode: energy-gradient modulation that shapes which surfaces get fed and which get starved. Evolved over Gyr for optimal tower architecture.

Together, symbiote genomes + network patterns constitute an effective construction program. The tower is the product. The symbiotes are the builders carrying the blueprints. The network is the project manager.

**Modern roots are Healer-maintained and extended.** In mature towers, Healers perform root construction and maintenance via arc-CVD directed along network energy gradients.

**⚠ OPEN: Pre-Healer root mechanism.** Canon states roots initially evolved as a means to sink excess power — which means roots must predate sophisticated symbiote behavior. The claim "no Healers = no roots" is too strong. Some pre-Healer root growth mechanism must exist (catalytic reaction extending laterally? simpler biological process?). The full Healer construction program requires sophisticated tower signaling, which requires tower-on-tower signal wars or at minimum significant tower/symbiote feedback loop evolution. Requiring all of this on a single tower instance before the first root is laid is brittle. Unresolved — assume a solution exists and proceed.

### 2.4 Additive AND subtractive manufacturing

Healers possess an arc tool. With CVD feedstock: construction (deposit new SiCN). Without feedstock: destruction (arc-vaporize existing SiC at ~2700°C). Same tool, two modes.

This gives the tower subtractive capability:
- Remove ceramified structure that is structurally suboptimal
- Carve chimney channels through solid lattice
- Excavate amorph habitat chambers
- Demolish and rebuild sections for progressive renovation
- **Reprogram signal-processing topology** — the lattice geometry IS the computation (every junction, pore, conductive path = circuit element). Adding/removing structure modifies the circuit. The tower is an FPGA; Healers are the programming interface. The network reprograms its own computational substrate in real time.

**Practical constraint:** Arc destruction costs energy. At the terminator (surplus power from lightning + piezoelectric + solar), this is not a meaningful constraint. On the deep dark side (energy-poor), demolition is expensive and renovation is rare.

### 2.5 Ship of Theseus: progressive in-situ replacement

Old or suboptimal towers are not toppled or abandoned. They are replaced section by section, in situ. Healers arc-destroy a strut, re-deposit the material as new lattice with proper signal infrastructure, move to the next strut. The SiC never leaves the site. Zero transport. Zero waste. The only cost is arc energy — surplus at the terminator.

The replacement front can work upward from the foundation. Below the front: new tower with proper signal-compatible lattice. Above: old tower being consumed. The tower remains functional throughout. Progressive replacement over centuries or millennia.

**Consequence: there are no old towers on the mature network.** Every tower position is ancient (fixed at nucleation). Every tower's material has been progressively renewed. The lattice in any given tower might be centuries old or recently replaced, but nothing dates to the original catalytic-accretion era. It has all been recycled through Healer construction.

The tower is immortal in the way a river is immortal: the position persists, the substance flows through it.

### 2.6 Tower aliveness spectrum

Towers exist on a spectrum, not as binary alive/dead:

| State | Symbiotes | Catalytic surface | Growth | Network | Architecture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full reef** | Active population, all guilds | Dead (buried under Healer deposits) | Healer-directed | Connected, managed | Optimized airfoil |
| **Degraded reef** | Reduced population, patchy | Possibly re-exposed in gaps | Mixed: Healer + crude catalytic | Connected but weakening | Deteriorating |
| **Reaction front only** | None or negligible | Active (exposed to atmosphere) | Crude autocatalytic accretion | Disconnected (no Healer root maintenance) | Primitive mound |
| **Inert** | None | Dead (passivated) | None | Disconnected | Fossil — permanent ceramics |

During the atmospheric crisis, towers degrade through this spectrum as SiH₄ drops and symbiote metabolism slows. The architecture degrades before the structure does.

### 2.7 Convergent architecture

Given geological time, the entire tower forest converges on the current best architecture for each location. Every accessible tower has been Ship-of-Theseus replaced by the same symbiote lineage using the same network management patterns. Regional variation reflects local conditions (wind, power, feedstock), not evolutionary history. The architectural fossil record is erased.

Towers from absorbed rival networks (assimilated during network wars) may have initially shown different architectural styles, but have long since been replaced with the current network's construction program.

The only towers with original ancient material would be those geologically isolated from the network — never reached by roots. These would be mineral mounds from the catalytic-accretion era: unremodeled, unconnected. Geological curiosities, not functional towers.

---

## 3. Phase 1: Filtration — Why an Airfoil?

### 3.1 The tower's primary function

The tower exists to intercept particulate-laden wind and extract building materials + SiH₄ feedstock. The windward face is the intake. Air passes THROUGH the porous lattice, not around it. Every strut surface inside the lattice is a collection site for particulate and a gas-exchange surface for SiH₄ metabolism.

### 3.2 Functional depth: 2-3 m

From fauna structural hub §9.7: the living zone occupies ~2-3 m depth from the windward face. After ~450 strut layers (at ~5 mm strut spacing), both particulate grit and SiH₄ are depleted from the through-flow. The five flow zones (windward face, transitional, core, transitional, leeward) are compressed into this 2-3 m envelope. Beyond it: stagnant, depleted.

This is the extraction-depth limit. Additional material behind this zone does not perform the primary function — it is structural and chimney infrastructure.

### 3.3 Symbiotic fauna amplify both capture and drag

Tower-coupled organisms (Healers, Miners, Guards) occupy the windward pore zone. Their bodies are additional collection surfaces and their metabolic activity processes captured material. This increases effective capture efficiency per unit depth.

However, organisms in pores also increase drag (partially occluding pore throats, increasing flow resistance). More organisms = better capture but higher wind loading per unit frontal area. The equilibrium balances these.

### 3.4 Why not circular?

A circular cross-section wastes material. The downwind half has no fresh wind passing through it — SiH₄ depleted, particulate filtered. The back half is structural deadweight from a filtration standpoint.

Healer-directed growth optimizes for feeding: deposit where it captures food, don't deposit where it doesn't. This produces a cross-section where the windward-facing shell is the functional zone and everything behind it serves structural or chimney functions only.

### 3.5 Why an airfoil and not a flat plate?

A flat plate perpendicular to the wind is structurally untenable at km scale in 1.82g under 370 Pa sustained load. Zero bending stiffness in the wind direction. Would fail by overturning.

The airfoil shape provides wind-axis depth at the center:
- Bending resistance against wind load (moment of inertia scales as D³)
- Structural anchorage for the root system (base buttresses extend leeward)
- Chimney conduit (interior cavity for H₂ venting)

The curvature of the windward face (convex toward wind) converts wind pressure into membrane compression along the arch — structurally efficient for SiC, which is strong in compression.

### 3.6 Why not a wedge or flat-front shape?

A flat windward face creates flow separation at the edges, losing particulate to turbulent wake zones on the flanks. A curved (convex) windward face wraps flow around the flanks smoothly, with the entire curved surface acting as collection area.

The Healer deposition pattern converges on this shape: maximum deposition rate at center of windward face (highest particle flux), decreasing along flanks (decreasing flux), minimal at the trailing edge (no particle flux, chimney vent function). This gradient naturally produces the airfoil taper.

---

## 4. Phase 2: Gas Exchange and Chimney Function

### 4.1 SiH₄ advection through the lattice

Wind at 9.5 m/s entering the porous lattice decelerates through successive strut layers. Pore-scale velocity at the face is ~10 m/s (Re ≈ 31,000 per strut). SiH₄ (0.3% atmospheric = 2,400 Pa partial pressure at 8 bar) is consumed by symbiote metabolism at each strut surface.

SiH₄ concentration profile is approximately exponential decay: C(x) = C₀ × exp(−x/λ), where λ ≈ 0.5-1 m (concentration drops to ~5% of inlet at 2-3 m depth). Matches the particulate-depletion depth — the biology has had Gyr to optimize so both resources exhaust at the same depth.

### 4.2 H₂ waste and the chimney

Core metabolism: SiH₄ → SiC + 2H₂. Hydrogen is inert waste.

H₂ density at 8 bar, 240K: ρ_H₂ = PM/(RT) = **0.80 kg/m³**
Atmospheric density: **8.2 kg/m³**
Buoyancy: Δρ × g = (8.2 − 0.80) × 17.85 = **132 Pa per metre of H₂ column height**
Wind dynamic pressure: **370 Pa**

A 3 m H₂ column generates buoyancy equal to the wind's dynamic pressure. Over km-scale height, the chimney draft is orders of magnitude stronger than wind. The tower interior is an active chimney.

### 4.3 Venturi-enhanced venting

Wind past the trailing edge creates a low-pressure zone. The airfoil taper to chimney vents produces Venturi suction, pulling gas upward and outward. Selection favors trailing-edge geometry that maximizes draft.

### 4.4 Trailing-edge vent geometry

**Discrete Healer-built vent openings, concentrated in the upper tower, sparse-to-absent at the base.**

- **Base (0-50 m):** Solid trailing edge. Maximum structural integrity needed for overturning resistance. Gas at ground level goes up, not out.
- **Mid-height:** Sparse, small vents. Some Venturi-assisted gas bleed. Structural webbing still connects flanks.
- **Upper tower:** Large, frequent vents. Maximum accumulated gas flow exits here. Structural loads minimal. Vent geometry shaped by Healer genomes for Venturi efficiency — nozzle-like (narrowing outward).
- **Apex:** Primary chimney exhaust is straight up through the top, not through trailing-edge vents.

The trailing-edge vents are secondary exhaust — Venturi-assisted pressure relief along the height. The primary exhaust exits upward through the apex.

### 4.5 Chimney phases: growth vs maturity

**Genesis/early-growth towers:** The chimney draws SiH₄ from the subsurface vent — wind-powered pump for the deep-rock system. H₂ column managed lightning targeting for ceramification.

**Mature towers:** Whole-body electrical potential management handles lightning. Chimney vents H₂ waste but is no longer the dominant shape constraint. Filter function and structural requirements dominate.

## 5. Phase 3: Structural Analysis

### 5.1 Material properties

| Property | Value | Source / Note |
|---|---|---|
| SiC bulk density | 3,210 kg/m³ | Standard |
| Aerogel solids fraction | 5-10% (assumed) | "Mostly void." Not canonized. |
| Bulk aerogel density | 160-320 kg/m³ | At 5-10% |
| SiC compressive strength | ~3,900 MPa | Standard 3C-SiC |
| SiC Young's modulus | ~400 GPa | Standard 3C-SiC |

### 5.2 Aerogel mechanical scaling

Gibson-Ashby scaling: σ_eff = C × σ_s × (ρ/ρ_s)^n

For random foams: n ≈ 1.5-2. For biologically optimized lattice (Gyr of selection): n ≈ 1-1.5. Using n = 1.5 (conservative):

| Solids fraction | Effective compressive strength | Effective modulus |
|---|---|---|
| 5% | ~9 MPa | ~1.3 GPa |
| 10% | ~25 MPa | ~3.8 GPa |

### 5.3 Maximum height from self-weight compression

At 5% solids: H_max = σ_eff / (ρ_bulk × g) = 9 × 10⁶ / (160 × 17.85) ≈ **3,100 m**

Tapering extends this by 50-70%. **Km-scale towers are structurally feasible.**

### 5.4 Overturning resistance

For a 1 km tower, 100 m wide: required base depth D_base > **~43 m**. The base must have substantial wind-axis depth for overturning stability, far exceeding the 2-3 m functional filter depth. The base is dominated by structural buttressing.

Bending stress at the base (~60 kPa) is negligible vs aerogel strength (9 MPa). **Self-weight compression governs maximum height; overturning governs minimum base depth.**

### 5.5 Growth history and progressive renovation

The tower's structure reflects its construction history. Ceramified lattice is permanent — but Healers can arc-destroy and rebuild it (§2.4).

**Initial construction:** When a tower is young and short, Healers build light, porous lattice optimized for feeding (low compressive stress, no reason to build heavy). As the tower grows taller, the base carries more load. But the base was built when the tower was short.

**Progressive renovation:** Healers at the base feel high compressive stress (via local measurement). Their genomes encode "deposit dense lattice under high stress" — selected over Gyr because Healer lineages that didn't build strong bases lived on towers that collapsed. The network directs energy to base renovation. Healers arc-destroy weak old struts and rebuild them denser. This is Ship of Theseus at the component level.

**At the terminator (surplus energy):** Renovation is unlimited. Every terminator tower has been progressively upgraded to structural optimality. Base density is whatever the Healer construction program produces under current loading — not limited by growth history.

**On the dark side (energy-poor):** Renovation is expensive. Dark-side towers are more constrained by growth history. Their bases may retain original light construction, limiting height.

### 5.6 Height-dependent cross-section profile

| Height zone | Wind-axis depth D | Cross-wind width W | Governing constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base (0-50 m) | 30-50 m | 100-200+ m | Overturning stability, root anchorage |
| Lower (50-200 m) | 15-30 m | 80-150 m | Compression taper |
| Mid (200-500 m) | 8-15 m | 50-100 m | Compression taper |
| Upper (500-1000 m) | 3-8 m | 20-60 m | Functional filter + minimal structure |
| Apex | 3-5 m | 10-30 m | Filter ridge, lightning collection |

Order-of-magnitude estimates for a ~1 km terminator tower.

**Shape vocabulary:** The base is a deep, wide buttressed arch — almost a mound, merging smoothly into the root system like tree-trunk root flares. The tower transitions upward into an increasingly thin wall-like profile. At the top, it is a curved porous blade. Overall silhouette: Gothic cathedral buttress — wide base sweeping up to a thin ridge.

### 5.7 Wind-axis depth partitioning (above the base)

| Zone | Depth | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Windward shell | 2-3 m | Active filter/lung. Living zone. All biology. |
| Interior void | 0-10 m (height-dependent) | Chimney conduit. H₂ venting. Structural webbing. Amorph habitat. |
| Leeward taper | 0.5-2 m | Trailing edge. Chimney vents (upper tower). Structural closure. |

Interior architecture: irregular vertical chimney channels separated by solid structural webbing. Shaped by chimney self-selection (same mechanism as deep-rock: surface-connected channels stay open via draft; dead-end pockets fill solid). Larger voids where amorphs have excavated habitat. Access via leeward vents (upper tower) and base openings (root-level gaps).

### 5.8 Apex geometry

**Broad ridge with gentle central peak.**

The tower top is a thin blade (3-5 m deep, 20-60 m wide). The apex is a horizontal ridge along the cross-wind axis:
- Maximum filter frontal area (ridge = line, point = zero area)
- Distributed lightning strikes along the ridge (vs dangerous current concentration at a single point)
- Primary chimney exhaust opening runs along the ridge

The central peak emerges from growth patterns — the center of the windward face has the highest SiH₄/particulate flux (stagnation zone), so Healer-directed growth is fastest there. No sharp spike needed — mature towers handle lightning through whole-body potential management regardless of strike location.

### 5.9 Network regulation of cross-wind width

Two mechanisms operate simultaneously:

**Local (no network input):** Flanks of the windward arch receive increasingly oblique wind. Particle flux and SiH₄ delivery per unit area drop with angle from stagnation center. At some width, marginal feeding return falls below symbiote maintenance cost. Growth self-limits. Soft maximum from local physics.

**Network (active management):** If tower A's flank shadows tower B's windward face, tower B's reduced intake → reduced network contribution → network reduces energy supply to tower A's flanks → Healer activity declines → growth stops there. Evolved behavioral response to reduced regional network performance. No understanding required.

Because towers are porous, wind shadowing is partial (most air goes through, not around). The shadow is a reduced-velocity plume, not a dead zone. Towers can pack closer than solid-body analysis would suggest. Fibonacci spacing is optimized for signal coverage (ping-latency), with shadowing as a secondary constraint managed by network energy modulation.

## 6. Towers Are Stationary

### 6.1 Wind cannot erode the tower

At v2.4 conditions (9.5 m/s, q = 370 Pa), aerogel strut strength (~20 MPa) exceeds wind-borne impact forces by 4-5 orders of magnitude. Only micro-scale pitting occurs. Healer repair completely negates pitting. Net erosion is zero.

### 6.2 No migration

The sand-dune migration model was based on a discarded high-wind environment. Under the current model:

- Windward erosion rate: zero (Healer repair dominates)
- Net displacement: zero. Towers are stationary.
- Position fixed at nucleation. Permanent unless destroyed by geological catastrophe.

### 6.3 Implications

- Towers nucleate at permanent positions via Fibonacci spacing rules.
- Tower populations at the deposition zone nucleated there via root network expansion, not migration.
- "Ghost roots" are the root network, not migration trails.

---

## 7. Porosity Profile

### 7.1 Windward-to-leeward gradient

| Region | Porosity | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Windward face (outer 0-0.5 m) | Moderate (~90%) | Dense enough to capture particles, open enough for airflow. Symbiote-occupied pores partially occluded. |
| Windward shell (0.5-2 m) | Higher (~93-95%) | Interior filter zone. Less particle impact, more gas exchange. |
| Living zone edge (2-3 m) | Highest (~95%+) | Transition to structural lattice. Last SiH₄ consumed. |
| Interior void | Variable | Mix of chimney conduits, structural webbing, amorph chambers. |
| Leeward taper/vent | Moderate (~90%) | Structural closure. Vent geometry for Venturi. |

### 7.2 Height gradient

- **Base:** Densest (~10-15% solid). High compressive loading. Healer renovation over Gyr has upgraded original light construction to structural optimum.
- **Mid-height:** Standard aerogel (~5-8% solid).
- **Top:** Lightest feasible (~3-5% solid). Minimum structure for filtration + lightning conduction. Youngest lattice.

At the terminator (surplus energy), the height gradient reflects full Healer optimization. On the dark side (energy-poor), the gradient reflects growth history more than renovation — base may retain original lighter construction.

---

## 8. Power Gradient and Regional Variation

### 8.1 Terminator energy surplus

A terminator tower has power surplus from three sources, all of which are just electricity to a piezoelectric semiconductor:

- **Lightning:** Continuous thunderstorm. Massive input.
- **Vibration:** 9.5 m/s sustained wind + volcanic micro-tremors on piezoelectric lattice.
- **Solar:** Star peak at 850 nm matches Si bandgap. Windward face is a solar panel.

The tower's problem at the terminator is managing *excess* power. Healer renovation and construction are energy-unconstrained.

### 8.2 Geographic power gradient

| Location | Power sources | Budget | Renovation capacity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terminator | Lightning + piezo + solar | Surplus | Unlimited — fully optimized architecture |
| Near dark side | Piezo (reduced) + some solar | Adequate | Moderate renovation |
| Deep dark side | Piezo (minimal) | Scarce | Minimal — growth-history-constrained |
| Anti-stellar | Near-zero | Minimal | Almost none — most primitive modern architecture |
| **Geothermal oasis** | **Geothermal (vent heat)** | **Surplus** | **Terminator-class despite dark-side location** |

### 8.3 Geothermal oasis towers

A dark-side tower on a geothermal vent with a SiH₄ pocket has terminator-class power and feedstock in an energy desert. Architecturally refined. Tall. Thriving symbiote population. Major network node. Anomalously sophisticated for its location.

Non-renewable: fossil SiH₄ pocket depletes. When exhausted, the tower degrades through the aliveness spectrum (§2.6). The architectural record betrays the ghost of a depleted pocket — a dark-side tower that's "too good" for its location.

These are the gas-pocket towers that eventually become monk monasteries.

### 8.4 Regional shape continuum

| Location | Wind | Shape | Aspect ratio (W:D) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terminator (θ=90°) | 9.5 m/s | Sharp airfoil. Tallest. Best Venturi. | 5:1 to 10:1 |
| Near dark (θ≈110°) | ~7 m/s | Blunter airfoil. | ~3:1 to 5:1 |
| Mid dark (θ≈135°) | ~4 m/s | Teardrop trending toward oval. Thicker filter. | ~2:1 to 3:1 |
| Deep dark (θ≈160°) | ~1-2 m/s | Nearly circular. No meaningful trailing edge. | ~1:1 to 2:1 |
| Anti-stellar (θ→180°) | ~0 m/s | Circular dome. Chimney by thermal convection. | 1:1 |

Wind velocity: v(θ) = v_term × (sin θ)^(−1/4), θ = angular distance from substellar point.

As wind decreases, the Venturi trailing edge loses purpose. Chimney vents migrate from the trailing edge to the apex (upward venting via buoyancy only). The airfoil cross-section smoothly transitions to circular. Filter zone thickens (slower advection → longer extraction path → SiH₄ penetrates deeper).

Day-side towers (θ < 60°) are unlikely — volcanism + rain stripping kills them.

## 9. Derived Properties

### 9.1 Acoustic shadow geometry

- **Aeolian tone source:** 2-3 m windward shell generates ~1 kHz from strut vortex shedding (St ≈ 0.2, v ≈ 10 m/s, d ≈ 2 mm).
- **Shadow zone:** Leeward side shielded. Sharp acoustic boundary at flanks.
- **Trailing-edge noise:** Chimney vents emit lower-frequency sound. Dominates leeward soundscape.
- **Shadow shape:** Geometric at 1 kHz (λ ≈ 0.37 m, diffraction around 100 m tower negligible). Extends many tower-widths downwind. Low frequencies fill in faster.
- **Ecology:** Leeward = low-frequency chimney noise, filtered Aeolian tone. "Filtered chord" zone. Subwoofer predators exploit shadow boundary.

### 9.2 EM antenna pattern

**Low frequency (λ >> tower):** Electrically small. Poor antenna. Incomplete Faraday shielding.

**Mid frequency (λ ~ tower width):** Gain broadside (along cross-wind axis). Null in wind direction (edge-on to thin profile).

**High frequency (λ << tower):** Complex multi-lobe. Overall: most sensitive broadside, systematic blind spots in wind direction.

**Key result:** Systematic EM blind spot in wind direction (upwind and downwind). Maximum sensitivity perpendicular to wind. Fibonacci array partially compensates via offset neighbors. Wind-axis blind spots are tactically exploitable in grid warfare.

### 9.3 Lattice flow zones

The 5-zone model (fauna structural hub §9.7) maps onto the airfoil windward shell without modification:

| Zone | Location on airfoil |
|---|---|
| Windward face | Leading edge / central windward surface |
| Pore throat | Between strut layers through the 2-3 m shell |
| Leeward face | Inner surface of struts facing away from wind |
| Junction pocket | Strut junctions throughout shell |
| Deep interior | Beyond living zone — chimney conduit |

No revision to the 5-zone model needed. Defined at strut scale, independent of macroscopic cross-section.

**Note on "deep interior":** The fauna hub describes this as "Nothing. Dead lattice. No biology." This is partially correct (no symbiote biology) but misleading — the interior serves active chimney function (H₂ venting, buoyancy-driven draft) and contains amorph habitat (chambers, passages). Functionally important, not "nothing."

| **Aspect ratio W:D at mid-height** | ~5:1 to 10:1 | Moderate |
| **Aerogel solids fraction** | 3-5% (top) to 10-15% (base) | Low — needs canonizing |
| **Apex** | Broad ridge, gentle central peak | Moderate |
| **Trailing-edge vents** | Discrete, upper-tower concentrated | Moderate |
| **Stationary** | Yes | High |

## 12. Remaining Open Questions

1. **Aerogel solids fraction:** Specific canonical values needed. The 3-15% range assumed here spans a factor of 5 in density and structural capacity.
2. **Interior architecture detail:** Chimney channel geometry, structural webbing pattern, amorph chamber distribution. Shaped by chimney self-selection + Healer excavation, but unquantified.
3. **Fibonacci spacing numbers:** What is the actual tower-to-tower distance at the terminator? Constrains maximum cross-wind width. Depends on root conductivity and network latency tolerance — no hard numbers available.
4. **Healer construction program specifics:** What behaviors are genomically encoded? Density response to stress signals, vent shaping, structural ribbing patterns? The "symbiote genome = tower blueprint" claim is well-grounded in principle but the specific behavioral repertoire is unspecified.
5. **Catalytic reaction status in modern towers:** Is the original autocatalytic surface definitely dead (buried under non-catalytic Healer deposits), or could it restart if exposed? Affects the crisis degradation pathway.
6. **Base-to-root transition:** Detailed geometry of the merge between tower base and root network. Smooth flare vs distinct boundary. Affects structural modeling of overturning resistance.
7. **Pre-Healer root mechanism:** Canon: roots evolved to sink excess power, predating sophisticated symbiotes. What builds the first roots? The catalytic reaction front doesn't exhibit lateral/subsurface growth behavior. Some intermediate mechanism is needed between "bare catalytic tower" and "Healer-built root network." Tower/symbiote coevolution can accelerate this, but the full sequence can't all happen on one tower instance before the first root connects two towers.
