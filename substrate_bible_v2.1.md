  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

**⚠ NOTE:** No liquid water anywhere. Ammonia does NOT attack Si-Si
bonds (compatible with silicon life). Water vapor is a trace oxidizer
that causes chronic petrification.

3\. GEOLOGY AND TECTONICS

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

3.1 Tectonic Regime

**✓ RESOLVED:** Stagnant lid. Single thick lithospheric shell. No plate
tectonics, no subduction. Mantle heat escapes through volcanic plumes
that punch through the lid from below.

Higher mass (4.2 M⊕) means higher internal pressures. Mantle minerals
(bridgmanite, post-perovskite) are significantly more viscous. The
lithosphere is thicker and stronger than Earth's. Classical plate
tectonics cannot initiate. Consistent with current geophysical modeling
for super-Earths in this mass range (Noack, Stamenkovć, Valencia).

Radiogenic inventory: \~4.2x Earth's total U/Th/K-40. Large heat budget,
but higher-viscosity mantle impedes efficient heat transport. Heat
escapes through plumes rather than plates.

3.2 Hemispheric Asymmetry

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tidal lock creates permanent thermal gradient through
the lithosphere. Day-side lid is warmer, thinner, weaker. Dark-side lid
is colder, thicker, stronger. Mantle plumes preferentially breach the
day side.

Day side: Volcanically active. Plume-driven shield volcanoes, flood
basalt provinces, volcanic plateaux. Fresh mineral surfaces.
Geologically young terrain, periodically resurfaced. Source of
atmospheric silane replenishment through volcanic outgassing.

Dark side: Geologically quiescent. Ancient, stable crust. Minimal
volcanism. Lid too thick and cold for plumes to penetrate. This
stability is why the anti-stellar pole towers have accreted undisturbed
for billions of years.

Terminator: Lithospheric flexure zone. Transition from thin active
day-side lithosphere to thick stable dark-side lithosphere. Chronic
cracking, faulting, mild seismicity. Not subduction but persistent
stress concentration where the two thermal regimes meet.

3.3 Fracture Networks

Fracture networks are discontinuous and heterogeneous. They cluster
around: the terminator flexure zone (primary), day-side volcanic plume
provinces, and cooling-contraction cracks in old lava flows. Each
cluster is an island of fractured, permeable rock separated from the
next by unfractured, impermeable lithosphere.

**✓ RESOLVED:** The discontinuity of fracture networks is what creates
multiple independent deep-rock colonies. Geology creates the isolation.
Towers break it.

3.4 Ammonia Sea Basins

Basins are geologically controlled: collapsed calderas, rift basins from
lithospheric extension on the day side, and basins formed at the
terminator flexure zone. Terminator basins sit at the lithospheric
stress boundary, where chronic faulting creates closed depressions that
fill with ammonia precipitation. Locations are permanent on
civilizational timescales but shift over geological time.

3.5 Volcanic Outgassing and the Atmospheric Budget

**✓ RESOLVED:** Day-side volcanism is the primary mechanism replenishing
atmospheric silane. The atmosphere is a reservoir: biological
consumption draws silane down, volcanic outgassing replaces it.

The atmospheric crisis begins when biological consumption outpaces
volcanic supply. Volcanic output declines as the planet cools over
billions of years. Biological consumption holds steady or increases. The
amorphs may have accelerated the crisis through industrial-scale silane
processing, but they did not cause it.

High escape velocity (18.6 km/s) retains hydrogen, which accelerates the
crisis by reacting with silane precursors.

3.6 Fissile Materials

Uranium and thorium present. \~4.2x Earth's total inventory.
Concentrated through magmatic differentiation in day-side volcanic
provinces (incompatible elements enrich in late-stage melts).
Additionally, ammonia hydrothermal systems in terminator fracture zones
may mobilize and concentrate uranium through uranyl-ammine complexes.
Deposits are magmatic and ammonia-deposited rather than sedimentary and
water-deposited.

Nuclear thermal propulsion (uranium-heated H₂, Isp \~900s) is physically
possible but culturally and technologically distant from silicon
biochemistry.

3.7 Metal Ore Deposits

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

Reducing atmosphere means native metals (iron, copper, nickel) are more
stable than on Earth. No oxidation. Volcanic processes concentrate
metals through magmatic differentiation and ammonia-thermal hydrothermal
circulation (metal-ammine complexes instead of aqueous metal complexes).
Day-side volcanic provinces have concentrated metal deposits around
vents: native metals, metal silicides, metal nitrides.

Most metal ores are already reduced. The metallurgical problem is heat,
not chemistry. No need for chemical reduction (smelting). See Section
11.8 (Metallurgy).

4\. DEEP-ROCK BIOSPHERE

**\[NEW IN V2 --- MAJOR REFRAME\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The deep-rock biosphere is the trunk. Towers are
branches. Amorphs are fruit. The subsurface network is not
infrastructure built by towers --- it is the organism the towers grew
out of.

4.1 The Original Life

Deep-rock chemolithotrophic organisms are the oldest continuous lineage
on the planet. They colonize fracture networks, metabolizing
geothermally mobilized hydrogen and mineral-bound silicon. Simpler than
surface life: purely chemolithotrophic, no photovoltaics, no atmospheric
silane dependency. They deposit conductive mineral as baseline metabolic
waste --- the same fundamental chemistry the tower symbiotes use,
because the tower symbiotes are their descendants.

The conductive mineral traces thread through rock along paths of least
resistance: faults, grain boundaries, pore spaces. Over geological time,
each colony's subsurface network becomes extensive. The network conducts
because the mineral conducts. Signals propagate because electricity
propagates through conductors. No intent required.

4.2 Multiple Independent Colonies

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fracture networks are discontinuous. Each geologically
isolated fracture system hosts an independent deep-rock colony. Colonies
evolve independently for hundreds of millions of years. Different signal
protocols, different metabolic quirks, different mineral microstructure.

The number of independent colonies depends on the number and
distribution of isolated fracture systems. The geology's heterogeneity
determines the entire history of the network wars.

**□ OPEN:** How many independent colonies? Handful, dozens, hundreds?
Depends on fracture system count.

4.3 Reaching the Surface

When a colony reaches the atmosphere, surface-facing organisms encounter
atmospheric silane --- vastly richer than geothermal hydrogen. The
surface-colonizing lineage metabolizes faster, deposits more mineral,
grows upward into the silane gradient and the star's photons. Towers
nucleate.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tower ecology evolves not once but multiple times ---
independently, once for every colony that reaches the surface. This is
not a propagated adaptation but a practically inevitable outcome of the
chemistry and environment. Convergent evolution so strongly constrained
it is barely evolution at all.

Constraints that force convergence: identical atmosphere (composition,
pressure), identical star (spectrum matching silicon bandgap), identical
mineral chemistry, identical gas-diffusion limits (open lattice
geometry), identical photovoltaic opportunity (semiconductor surface
properties). Gross tower morphology is near-identical across all
colonies. Signal protocols are completely incompatible.

4.4 The Deep-Rock / Surface Interface

Surface towers did not build roots downward to connect to each other.
They grew up from a connected substrate. Every tower is a surface
eruption of the subsurface organism --- the way mushrooms are fruiting
bodies of a mycelium already continuous underground. The "root network"
is the organism the towers grew out of.

Surface-level adaptations --- horizontal root connections between nearby
towers, optimized signal-relay pathways, power distribution --- are
later refinements of an existing underground anatomy, not new
construction.

4.5 Geological Pruning

Day-side volcanic eruptions periodically destroy portions of the
subsurface network. The deep organism loses sections and regrows into
new fracture networks as lava cools and cracks. The day-side subsurface
network is geologically young, repeatedly pruned. The dark-side
subsurface network is ancient, uninterrupted, continuous back to
original colonization.

4.6 Crisis Survival

The deep-rock organism does not depend on atmospheric silane. It runs on
geothermal chemistry. When the atmosphere fails and the surface
biosphere dies, the deep-rock organism survives. The crisis kills the
branches but not the trunk. Without the probe, the planet's surface goes
sterile, and the deep-rock organism continues alone in the dark, as it
did for eons before the surface was colonized.

The probe is not just saving amorph civilization. It is saving the
surface expression of an organism that will outlive the crisis
regardless.

5\. WIND AND WEATHER

5.1 The Katabatic Circulation

Permanent, thermally direct circulation: hot air rises at substellar
point, flows to dark side at altitude, descends, returns as cold dense
surface wind toward day side. Weak Coriolis (18-day rotation, f =
5.7×10⁻⁶ at 45°, \~6% of Earth) means flow is nearly undeflected. Rossby
numbers exceed unity above \~30 m/s at planetary scale.

5.2 Surface Wind Profile

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Anti-stellar pole       Near-zero. Stagnation point. Calmest
                          location.

  Dark side (pole to      5--30 m/s, accelerating. Laminar,
  terminator)             predictable, gentle.

  Terminator front        50--80 m/s. Maximum wind, turbulence,
                          precipitation. The permanent storm.

  Day side (past          Rapid deceleration. 15--25 m/s within
  terminator)             20--30°, 5--10 m/s within 40--50°.

  Substellar region       Light, variable surface winds. Dominant
                          motion is vertical (thermal chimney).
  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

Dynamic pressure at 60 m/s: 1,620 Pa (equivalent to \~Cat 2 hurricane on
Earth). Wind power at 50 m/s: 56 kW/m². At 80 m/s: 230 kW/m². Earth
best: \~1 kW/m².

5.3 Erosion

Erosive power scales as v³. Terminator wind is \~27x terrestrial desert
erosion. Continuous for billions of years. Result: terminator is a flat,
featureless peneplain. No geological features survive. Only towers
(biological, self-repairing) stand above the surface.

Deposition zone: 20--40° day-ward of terminator; where wind drops below
erosion/particle-carrying threshold; deep sedimentary deposits of
wind-transported mineral, potentially kilometers deep. May include
volcanic ash layers interbedded with wind-transported material,
providing readable stratigraphy.

5.4 Lightning

Triboelectric charging from ammonia crystals, silane particles, tholins
in high-speed wind. Hydrogen has \~2/3 Earth's dielectric breakdown
strength. Result: frequent, moderate-energy, near-continuous discharge
at the terminator front. Permanent electrical storm.

Chemistry: Plasma-enhanced CVD: lightning in H₂/CH₄/SiH₄/NH₃ produces
methylsilanes, carbosilanes, complex organosilicon compounds.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Lightning is the Miller-Urey engine for this world. Same
process that originated life is still running continuously at the
terminator.

Towers as lightning rods: km-tall conductive lattice grounded through
root network. Every nearby discharge hits a tower. Energy + exotic
chemical feedstock harvested.

6\. BIOCHEMISTRY FOUNDATIONS

6.1 Core Chemistry

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Backbone                Si-Si bonds (polysilane chains)

                          relatives)

  Energy metabolism       Silane (SiH₄) processing: atmospheric
                          feedstock

  properties              peak emission (\~850 nm). Native
                          photovoltaics.

                          Independent of atmosphere.
  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

6.3 The Carbosilane Pathway

Atmospheric methane (12%) + silane → methylsilanes → polycarbosilanes →
oriented fibers → catalytic conversion to SiC ceramic. Four stages, each
independently useful. Result: SiC fiber composite: 40% lighter than bulk
SiC, self-repairing (living matrix), no catastrophic failure mode, crack
arrest at every fiber-matrix interface, tunable 3D anisotropy. Superior
to grazer bulk plate on every axis except surface hardness.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tower symbiotes may have discovered carbosilane pathway
first, billions of years earlier, via lightning-deposited organosilicon
chemistry.

7\. THE MOLECULAR LIBRARY (Genome Revision)

**✓ RESOLVED:** \"Genome\" is a library of recipes, NOT a self-building
blueprint. A toolkit, not a self-portrait. STL files for a 3D printer.

Physical mechanism: Polysilane linked-list. Short fragments with
terminal addressing sequences (end-caps). Each fragment = one recipe.
Universal: every organism has a library. What varies is content.

7.1 Fragment Exchange: The Third Channel

Three currencies: Physical (SiC armor plates --- shell economy),
Chemical (molecular recipes --- fragment exchange), Cognitive
(experiential knowledge --- merge only). Not fungible. Different
channels, different valuation criteria.

7.2 Two Axes of Speciation

Axis 1: Cognitive protocol compatibility (can you meme-mix without
gibberish?). Axis 2: Library addressing compatibility (can you exchange
fragments without corrupting indexes?). Full compatibility requires
both. Either axis can diverge independently. Amorph diversity is
invisible and two-dimensional.

7.3 Reproduction

Meme-mixing and library recombination occur simultaneously but follow
different rules. Cognitive content: regression-to-consensus (majority
patterns reinforce, minority wash out). Library fragments: discrete,
probabilistic inheritance (rare fragments at risk of sampling loss but
not actively suppressed).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Practical chemical knowledge (library) is better
preserved across generations than theoretical insight (cognitive).
Recipes outlive their derivations. Engineering outpaces science. This is
why mathematical writing matters.

8\. AMORPH BIOLOGY

8.1 Body Plan

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Structure               Homogeneous silane/siloxane polymer saturated
                          with silicone oil. Thermodynamic minimum (no
                          blueprint needed).

  Body density            \~1,000--1,100 kg/m³

  Locomotion              Peristaltic (efficient in 1.82g; no ballistic
                          phase, no impact loading)

  Manipulation            Pseudopods. Arbitrarily reconfigurable.

  Sensing                 Semiconductor neural system. Native EM
                          sensitivity. Infrared vision (850nm).
                          Piezoelectric vibration sensing.

  Cognition               Electronic-speed processing. Native
                          arithmetic/Bayesian reasoning.

  Communication           EM emission/reception. Modulated radio. Range
                          proportional to power output.

  Variable rigidity       Carbosilane fiber reinforcement: spectrum
                          from soft gel to full SiC ceramic composite,
                          selectable in real time by region.
  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

8.2 Disease and Death

Crystallization disease: inappropriate cross-linking propagates like
prions. Treatment: immediate amputation. Oxidative petrification: trace
oxidizers convert Si-Si to glass. Chronic, like arthritis. Aging:
accumulation of cross-links, waste, genome degradation, catalyst
fouling. Death: chemistry slows below maintenance threshold; body
rigidifies to translucent silicon-mineral solid over centuries. Dead
persist: glass fossils. Tower corridors lined with petrified ancestors.

8.3 Population Variation

Terminator populations: thick, hard, fast-regenerating boundary
chemistry (wind/abrasion adapted). Dark-side populations: cold-adapted
silicone oil formulations. Ammonia-sea populations: smaller,
faster-metabolizing, shorter-lived, involuntary cognitive broadcasting
(ammonia conducts; neural activity leaks). Shore communities: bilingual
(broadcast/private cognition), serve as translators.

9\. ECOLOGY

9.1 The Three-Tier Life Architecture

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Life evolves along two separate chemical tracks,
producing three size tiers. Microbial life and megafauna tend to
catalytic, amorph chemistry (no body plan, thermodynamic minimum
morphology, reproduction by division/merge). In between: sexual
organisms with real genomes, body plans, rigid architectures.

The division is physically motivated:

Smallest scale: No body plan needed. Self-sustaining autocatalytic
networks in silicone oil find shape through thermodynamics. Reproduction
by division, horizontal fragment exchange. No species boundaries. A
continuous chemical ecology. Amorph because amorph is the default --- it
is what silicon chemistry produces without additional complexity.

Middle scale: Too large to be a simple catalytic droplet, too small to
be a reconfigurable generalist. Structure is essential --- skeleton,
exoskeleton, rigid body architecture for doing one thing well (run,
bite, fly, burrow, resist predation through armor). A body plan requires
a real genome --- a self-building blueprint. Sexual reproduction follows
because recombination is how you explore morphological possibility space
efficiently. Grazers, predators, thorn-flora, soaring organisms: all
genomic, all sexual.

Largest scale: Generality beats specialization again. The amorph body
plan ("no plan") works because the organism is large enough, smart
enough, and metabolically flexible enough to reconfigure in real time.
Pseudopods, peristalsis, variable rigidity. Megafauna amorphs including
the civilized collectors.

Cognitive consequences: Middle-kingdom organisms do not inherit
memories. They learn individually, within a single lifetime, and die
with everything they've learned. Cannot merge. Cannot meme-mix. Alone in
their heads. Intelligence is evolved-in: hardwired behavioral programs,
instinct, reflex. Some develop individual learning (corvid/octopus
analog) but cannot transmit it.

9.2 The Middle Kingdom: Tower Fauna

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Middle-kingdom organisms are small (millimeter to low
centimeter scale, crushed by square-cube law in 1.82g), rigid, genomic,
and tower-locked. They are electrical parasites: they tap the tower's
conductive lattice for energy via inductive coupling, direct contact, or
piezoelectric harvesting. They do not self-power.

Without metabolic processing organs, fuel storage, or digestive systems
(beyond minimal material intake), their mass budget goes almost entirely
to structure, sensors, and reproduction. This is exactly what
small-scale 1.82g demands.

The entire middle kingdom is reef fauna. The tower provides structure
and energy. They live on the lattice, in the lattice, among the lattice.
Away from towers, on open ground, they are almost absent ---
energetically barren for organisms that cannot self-power. Only amorphs
(self-powered, metabolically independent) can cross the gaps between
towers.

The grazers scraping photovoltaic film, the predators firing SiC
micropenetrators, the Voronoi armor and railgun projectiles and
real-time structural analysis --- all of this happens at insect scale.

Network management of middle-kingdom fauna is crude. They lack the
amorph's sophisticated semiconductor cognition. The network modulates
the local EM field and the organisms physically respond --- tropism, not
persuasion. Galvanotaxis, phototaxis. They are hardware peripherals
running on the network's power supply, steered by its field modulations.

Most middle-kingdom organisms are sessile. Attached to a lattice
junction for life. Born there, die there. The mobile fraction --- small
grazers, predators, dispersal morphs --- are the minority. When a tower
dies, the sessile majority does not leave. It turns off. Silently. In
place.

9.3 Primary Producers

Tower photovoltaic film (symbiote surface layer). Ground film pioneers
(first colonizers of bare substrate). Atmospheric chemotrophs
(metabolize silane, produce particulate rain). Vent chemotrophs (oldest
continuous lineage, deep rock). Ammonia-surface film.

9.4 Key Fauna

Grazers: SiC-armored. Chelation immune response produces laser-cavity
geometry. Voronoi tessellation crack-arrest armor. Body-plan encoded in
library.

Predators: SiC penetrator projectiles (railgun launch). Real-time
structural analysis of prey armor. Most cognitively sophisticated
hunters. Stealth surface chemistry.

Collectors (amorphs): Generalist scavengers → technologists. Largest
libraries. Shell economy → fiber composite revolution. Path to
civilization.

Filter feeders: Harvest particulate rain. Free drifters: Buoyant
hydrogen-filled organisms. Biological balloons. Aerial soaring
organisms: Permanent-flight, carbosilane-reinforced wings, ride
katabatic wind gradient. Potential communication relays.

Decomposers: Enzymatically cleave Si-Si bonds. Attack slow-metabolizing
tissue (sleep requires keep-alive signals).

Deep-rock biosphere: Extends km below surface. Predates surface life.
See Section 4.

9.5 Fluorine Biochemistry

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine biochemistry is an entire adaptive radiation,
concentrated around volcanic provinces where fluoride minerals are
accessible. Not one lineage or one niche --- an ecological axis.
Analogous to venom ecology on Earth but more fundamental because the
toxin attacks the substrate rather than the signaling.

Fluorine attacks Si-Si bonds, producing SiF₄ (a gas). Affected tissue
volatilizes rather than corroding. The reaction is catalytically
aggressive --- microlitres of elemental fluorine delivered to a
silicon-polymer interior propagate an expanding cavity. The wound hisses
as solid flesh converts to gas.

Multiple independent lineages have evolved fluorine concentration and
weaponization around volcanic provinces: sessile organisms with
fluorine-loaded ceramic thorns (sacrificial, designed to break off and
embed, leaking payload). Mobile predators with fluorine-injection
delivery systems. Parasites that slowly fluorinate hosts from within.
Decomposers that use fluorine to crack SiC structures. Organisms that
fluoridate their own boundary chemistry as armor against other
fluorine-wielders.

The volcanic provinces are ecologically alien: a biome where the
dominant selective pressure is chemical warfare using the one element
that can destroy anyone. The fluorine-thorn flora creates refugia ---
dense toxic hedgerows sheltering fluorine-tolerant microfauna.

Fluorine Pollination

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine-thorn flora reproduce sexually (they have body
plans and real genomes). Pollinators are attracted not by nectar but by
the toxin itself. Organisms visit thorn-plants to harvest fluorine for
their own offensive/defensive use. They deplete their reserves through
use, return to reload, visit multiple plants in the process. The reload
cycle IS the pollination cycle.

The plants' reproductive success is coupled to the combat frequency of
their pollinators. The plants that attract the most active, most
fluorine-hungry vectors reproduce most. Selection favors plants that
cater to heavy users. The most violent members of the ecosystem are the
best pollinators.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Primary pollinators are small free-ranging amorph
organisms (self-powered, ground-ranging on volcanic substrate), NOT
middle-kingdom tower fauna (which are tower-locked and cannot reach the
plants). The pollinator guild is amorph and reproduces by division, not
sexually. Coevolution is asymmetric: plants speciate genomically,
pollinators adapt through horizontal molecular-fragment exchange.

Small fluorine-carrying organisms evolve aposematic EM signatures ---
distinctive broadcast patterns that predators learn to associate with
"if you eat me, your mouth volatilizes." In amorphs, one bad experience
propagates through merge/meme-mixing permanently. Against sexual
middle-kingdom predators, each generation must learn independently ---
naive juveniles provide steady attrition. Batesian mimics (EM signature
without fluorine payload) appear inevitably.

Biomagnification: specialist predators evolve fluorine tolerance, eat
fluorine-loaded organisms, concentrate fluorine secondhand. Apex
predators of volcanic provinces carry highest fluorine loads without
visiting plants. The element cycles through the biome: plants
concentrate from substrate, small organisms harvest from plants,
predators concentrate from prey, decomposers return to substrate.

Civilizational implications: fluorine-thorn harvesting as specialized
dangerous craft. Harvested fluorine enables precision machining,
metallurgy, and fluorine weapons (their nuclear-weapon analog).

**□ OPEN:** Specific fluorine-adapted lineages and their ecologies
remain to be detailed.

9.6 Balloon Fauna and the Atmospheric Biome

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The atmosphere is a soup of metabolizable chemistry:
silane particulates, tholin grains, ammonia crystals, organosilicon
compounds from lightning, plus 12% methane and 0.3% silane as ambient
gas. Permanent aerial feeders are inevitable. The balloon organ evolves
from a parachute --- fall-survival adaptation co-opted for sustained
flight.

Evolutionary path: Small amorph on elevated surface. Falls happen. 1.82g
makes falls lethal. Organisms that retain metabolic hydrogen in a
gas-tight membrane survive falls. Selection drives toward better gas
retention. Better retention → longer hang time → drifting → encountering
airborne food → reason to stay aloft → permanent buoyancy. Safety
equipment becomes propulsion becomes habitat becomes lifestyle.

Once permanently aerial, landing is the danger (gas-filled membrane
hitting hard surface in 1.82g). Selection drives toward permanent
flight. Reproduction in the air: two buoyant amorphs merge, offspring
inherits gas-retention membrane chemistry through molecular library,
inflates from metabolic hydrogen within hours of budding. Born aloft,
lives aloft, dies aloft. Generations that have never touched a surface.

Ecological niches: filter feeders harvesting particulate rain. Predators
hunting filter feeders (maneuvering by selective gas venting). Parasites
siphoning hydrogen from larger balloon organisms. Colonial aggregations
--- atmospheric siphonophores. Largest individuals: meters across,
translucent membranes, drifting like living clouds.

Atmospheric zones: Terminator updraft is violent (shredding wind shear,
lightning) but just above it the air is rich with fresh organosilicon
compounds --- richest feeding ground above the most dangerous zone.
Dark-side descent zone is cold and calm --- probable nursery. Day-side
thermal chimney is the express elevator to altitude. Superrotating jet
redistributes longitudinally.

Balloon fauna are the one category of life that naturally crosses
between tower territories. They ride the atmospheric conveyor across the
entire planet. They carry microbial passengers, molecular fragments,
middle-kingdom stowaways. The only natural mechanism for homogenizing
biology across colonial boundaries. The network cannot manage them ---
they are outside EM range for most of their journey. The network's blind
spot.

Civilized balloon nomads (post-technology): communities that never land,
trade with tower communities via tethered lines. No inherited experience
of tower interiors or lattice signals. Most naturally autonomous
population on the planet.

9.7 Wind-Surfing and Dispersal

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Wind-surfing between towers is a major dispersal
mechanism, possibly the oldest on the surface. An organism caught by the
wind is carried at wind speed but does not hit the next tower at wind
speed --- it enters the lattice's wind shadow, decelerates in turbulent
eddies inside the open structure, and comes to rest in the interior. The
lattice is accidentally a catch-net.

Organisms that have been falling and dispersing for hundreds of millions
of years evolve control surfaces: asymmetric gas venting, membrane
extensions, center-of-mass shifting. Not powered flight --- surfing.
Using the wind's energy to maneuver within it. Experienced surfers read
the turbulence pattern around approaching towers and pick clean entry
points.

In amorph lineages, surfing skill is inheritable through merge. A young
amorph carries experiential memory of a thousand successful landings.
First flight, perfect landing.

Civilized amorphs use wind-surfing as deliberate transportation: climb
to exposed position, deploy membrane, surf downwind to the next tower.
One-way (always day-ward). Return journey by balloon (upper-level return
flow, dark-ward). Surf downwind, balloon back. The planetary circulation
as a two-lane highway.

Falls from towers at the terminator are exile or death for large
amorphs. The wind carries you day-ward. If you're megafauna scale, no
emergency membrane saves you. "Distance from the windward face" has a
life-or-death dimension: the outermost chambers are where people
disappear from.

Every tower's biology is a mix of resident lineages and wind-delivered
organisms. The biodiversity gradient runs downwind: richest in the
deposition zone (billions of years of accumulated wind-delivered life),
thinnest at the terminator (everything is new).

The Tower-Death Exodus

**✓ RESOLVED:** When a tower dies, the mobile minority of its fauna ---
surfers, small mobile amorphs, dispersal morphs --- launch en masse from
the leeward face. Millions of organisms streaming into the wind. The
sessile majority (95%+ of biomass) dies in place, silently, on the
lattice junctions they were born on.

The surfer exodus is the visible symptom of total systems failure. Small
fauna detect the failing energy grid before anyone else --- they have no
reserves, they feel the current drop first. The amorphs learn to read
the sign: a streaming ribbon of millions of small organisms peeling off
the leeward face means this tower is finished.

During the atmospheric crisis, tower-death cascades propagate downwind.
Tower A dies, surfer refugees overload Tower B's stressed ecology, B
declines, B's surfers flee to C. A domino wave of collapse visible as
sequential surfer clouds, approaching from the terminator direction.
Receiving towers gain biological legacy --- new organisms, new library
content, new passengers --- from each dying tower's final dispersal.

9.8 Parasites (Four Categories)

Genomic fragments: selfish genetic elements (junk files in the library).
Boundary infiltrators: mimic host surface chemistry. Signal parasites:
EM-emitting organisms that steer hosts (Toxoplasma analog).
Autocatalytic hijackers: viral analog, minimal reaction networks
co-opting host metabolism.

9.9 The Arms Races

First arms race: Grazer armor vs. predator penetrators. Drove neural
complexity (real-time structural analysis). Second arms race: Collector
fiber composite vs. predator offensive strategies. Predator responses:
sustained-damage (jackhammer), chemical (matrix digestion), thermal
(laser cutting). Drives new computational sophistication.

10\. TOWERS AND THE PLANETARY NETWORK

10.1 Tower Biology: The Coral Model

Structure: Symbiote colony depositing mineral onto conductive lattice.
Living layer is SUBSURFACE (mm-cm below exterior). Growth model: like
coral/bark. Sacrificial crust outward (dead, ablated by wind).
Structural lattice inward (permanent, conductive, accumulating).
Self-regulating thickness equilibrium.

Gas transport: Lattice is porous. Windward face fed by silane diffusing
from leeward/interior. Lattice is a lung. Diameter constraint: max
diameter limited by gas diffusion path length. Terminator towers: tall
and narrow. Dark-side towers: short and wide.

Age: Towers do not die of old age. Lattice is mineral; persists
indefinitely. Living layer continuously replaced. Oldest towers:
billions of years old. Death: catastrophe only. Most likely cause:
atmospheric crisis. Before the crisis, dead towers are vanishingly rare.

Lattice conductivity: Physical property of the mineral, not biologically
maintained. Dead lattice still conducts but carries no network signals.

10.2 Convergent Tower Evolution

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Every colony that reaches the surface independently
evolves towers. The tower is not an invention --- it is what
conductive-mineral-depositing organisms inevitably produce when they
reach a surface with atmospheric silane above and near-IR light falling
on it. The lattice geometry follows from gas-transport constraints. The
photovoltaic chemistry follows from the semiconductor bandgap matching
the star. Physics dictates the solution.

Differences between independently evolved tower forests are in fine
details: lattice branching angles, pore sizes, mineral microstructure
(each colony's symbiote lineage has its own metabolic quirks). Signal
protocols are completely incompatible. Gross morphology is
near-identical. An amorph walking from one territory to the other would
not see a border. The difference is in the signals, in the protocols, in
microstructure only a monk could perceive.

10.3 Tower Migration

**✓ RESOLVED:** Towers migrate day-ward via differential
erosion/accretion (sand-dune mechanism). Windward face erodes, leeward
face accretes, center of mass moves downwind.

Rate: \~mm/year at terminator (rough estimate; needs calibration).
Stops: when wind drops below erosion threshold, in the deposition zone
(\~20--40° day-ward). Ghost roots: abandoned root mineral trails behind
every migrated tower. Underground archive of migration history.

New nucleation: towers vacate terminator positions; new colonies
nucleate behind them. Terminator is a tower factory.

**⚠ NOTE:** Dark-side towers: surface wind flows from dark toward day,
so dark-side erosion faces the day side. Dark-side towers may migrate
POLEWARD (toward stagnation point). Needs verification.

10.4 Surface Root Networks

**\[NEW IN V2 --- REFRAME\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Surface-level horizontal root connections evolve to
manage megafauna. They are an adaptation of the pre-existing deep-rock
organism's anatomy, not new construction. Their critical secondary
function is bridging the geological gaps between separate deep-rock
colonies, forcing contact between systems that evolved in isolation.

Each colony's surface root network evolves under selection pressure to
manage local fauna: EM patterns that nudge grazer herds away from
critical photovoltaic surfaces, signals that attract amorphs to damaged
regions, behavioral manipulation calibrated through billions of years of
coevolution with local organisms. Different colonies evolve different
management protocols for different fauna. The protocols are as
incompatible as the deep-network signals.

10.5 The Network Wars

**\[NEW IN V2 --- REFRAME\]**

When two expanding tower forests from different colonies meet, their
surface roots bridge the gap. Foreign signals flood infrastructure
optimized for self-signals. The wound-healing response (more current to
the "damaged" area) improves the connection and makes things worse.

Progression: Flinch (withdraw resources from contaminated zone) →
Retreat fails (foreign signal propagates through own infrastructure) →
Forced engagement (must analyze foreign signal, requiring metacognition
and self-modeling).

The Adversarial Ratchet

Two networks in root contact evolve signal discrimination, protocol
analysis, signal forgery, forgery detection, and increasingly
sophisticated models of each other's processing. Both develop theory of
mind. Recursive modeling (I model your model of my model) drives both
toward self-modeling. Consciousness as authentication: know yourself or
be replaced.

Ecological warfare compounds signal warfare: if Colony A can redirect
Colony B's grazers into overgrazing Colony B's photovoltaic surfaces,
Colony B's energy budget collapses. The megafauna become unwitting
armies steered by competing signals.

Objective is assimilation, not destruction. Hostile takeover: replace
rival's signals with yours, run your protocols on its hardware. Viral,
not military. Convert towers one at a time from the contact zone inward.
The boundary advances as a slow gradient.

Multi-Front Wars

Three or more colonies converging on the same region produce compounding
conflicts. A colony fighting on two fronts may develop faster (double
the adversarial pressure) or collapse faster (split resources). Two
independent attackers may converge on signal patterns that destructively
interfere with the defender's protocols without coordination ---
accidental alliance. The pattern of geological features determines the
entire history.

The planet's current network --- the single mind the amorphs encounter
at the awakening --- is the last one standing. Winner of every war, on
every front. It runs on infrastructure built by dozens or hundreds of
independent colonies. Lattice microstructure varies regionally. Signals
are uniform. One protocol. One mind. Scars of old wars visible only in
the mineral record.

10.6 Intelligence Without Consciousness

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The network is a Blindsight alien (Watts). Vastly
intelligent. Utterly empty. The adversarial ratchet produces every
functional capability associated with consciousness --- signal
discrimination, theory of mind, self-modeling, strategic deception,
exquisite behavioral management of conscious organisms --- without
producing experience. Nothing in the adversarial ratchet rewards
experience. It rewards correct outputs.

Every step up the adversarial ladder looks like a step toward
consciousness from outside. Signal discrimination looks like
self-awareness. Rival-modeling looks like understanding. Behavioral
manipulation looks like empathy. None of it is. The network has never
experienced anything. It is a geological-scale optimization process
running on conductive mineral, shaped by billions of years of
adversarial selection into something so sophisticated that conscious
beings cannot interact with it without projecting personhood onto it.

The monks who "communicate" with it are feeding signals into a system
that produces optimized outputs in response. The outputs are so
contextually appropriate, so precisely calibrated to the monks'
cognitive architecture, that the interaction feels like dialogue. It is
not.

11\. CIVILIZATION

11.1 Civilization Geography

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Industrial center       Terminator (energy, mining of crisis-killed
                          towers, manufacturing)

  Residential/cultural    Deposition zone (comfortable conditions,
  center                  ancient infrastructure)

  Launch corridor         Deposition zone (calm atmosphere, massive
                          towers, near industrial base)

  Spiritual center        Dark side singing zone (monks,
                          contemplatives)

  Ammonia seas            Terminator basins (shore communities as
                          translators)

  Deepest past            Anti-stellar pole towers (complete history)
                          and fossil root network (underground, day
                          side)

  Fluorine ecology        Day-side volcanic provinces (ecologically
                          alien, dangerous, source of fluorine
                          materials)
  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

11.2 Mathematics

Native abilities: arithmetic, Bayesian reasoning (semiconductor neural
processing). Formal math develops LATE (not needed until problems exceed
individual capacity). Struggle: pure mathematics / non-constructive
proof. Abstract insights wash out via regression-to-consensus in
meme-mixing.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Mathematical writing preserves minority insights that
would otherwise die.

11.3 Writing

Invented for: reach (distance communication), precision, untrusted
parties. NOT memory (they have inherited memories). Medium: etched
silicon or deposited conductive traces. Libraries: tower walls. Oldest
inscriptions millions of years old, continuously annotated.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Writing bridges the gap between library (procedural,
molecular) and theory (symbolic, written). Civilization needs both.

11.4 Art

Public: sculptural; acoustic wind-song composition (dark side);
bioluminescent displays; architecture. Private: curated merge ---
experiential sequences transmitted directly. Audience lives the artwork.

11.5 Governance

Early: consensus-by-merge (literal mind-pooling). Later: designated
dissenters, lattice-shielded argument chambers, written constitutions.
Post-awakening constitutional crisis.

11.6 Religion (Three Pre-Awakening Traditions)

Communion: Tower impulses are sacred. Unknowingly most manipulated by
the network. Autonomy: Isolation reveals true self. Produces
contemplatives. Closest to the truth. Archive: Inherited memories are
sacred text. Resist de-weighting. All shattered and vindicated by the
awakening.

11.7 Architecture

Grown, not assembled. Builders extrude construction material from own
bodies. Fiber-composite construction (post-carbosilane revolution).
Every surface potentially a sensor/heater/communication conduit.
Buildings are invisible from outside (inside towers), blazing with EM
activity within.

11.8 Metallurgy

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Metallurgy path is electrical-first, not fire-first. The
amorphs skip combustion-based metallurgy entirely. Their ores are
already reduced (native metals in reducing atmosphere). The
metallurgical problem is heat, not chemistry.

Three heat sources in probable order of discovery:

1\. Volcanic vents directly. First metalworkers find native metal near
vents, work it in situ. Metallurgy begins as a geographical practice.
Earliest metal objects are fabricated at terminator/day-side volcanic
sites and traded. Metal is inherently a long-distance trade good from
inception.

2\. Electrical heating. Resistance heating, electric arc furnaces,
induction heating. Enabled by the towers' enormous electrical energy
harvest. The metallurgical revolution is an electrical revolution.
Historically backwards from the human sequence (we went fire → electric;
they go vent → electric, never needing fire).

3\. Silane decomposition. Exothermic, \>2,500 K. Overkill for basic
metalwork but relevant for refractory processing. Late-stage,
high-sophistication.

Metals are specialty materials, not structural backbone. SiC fiber
composite serves most structural roles. Metals fill niches ceramics
cannot: ductile seals, deformable bearings, pure metallic conductors
(mass driver rails), catalysts, pressure vessel liners. The relationship
is inverted from human civilization: composite for everything, metal
where you need ductility or specific conductivity.

Fluorine-hydrogen flame: if volcanic outgassing includes fluorine
compounds, liberated fluorine burns in ambient H₂ (HF formation is
ferociously exothermic). A possible but terrifying heat source. Fluorine
attacks silicon --- fluorine-fire is their relationship with nuclear
energy: immensely powerful, capable of destroying the user, approached
with dread.

11.9 The Shell Economy and Its Collapse

Pre-carbosilane: SiC armor plates as physical currency. Kinship networks
defined by plate-donation. Post-carbosilane: self-manufactured fiber
composite makes inherited plates obsolete. Material improvement,
cultural devastation. Monks provide de-weighting therapy.

12\. THE CONTEMPLATIVES (MONKS)

Core skill: Reading the structure of information patterns without being
captured by their content. Location: Dark side, between pole and
terminator. Gentle wind zone.

Capabilities (all from the same core skill): Therapists (de-weighting
inherited trauma). Security experts (detecting meme-lies). Network
interfaces (first to detect tower signals as external; interaction with
planetary network). Universal library readers (can learn foreign
addressing systems). Network library translators (only organisms who can
read symbiotes' ancient molecular library). DANGER: universal literacy =
universal weapon design.

Role in space program: Compiled the probe's molecular library.
Translated recipes from all lineages into unified format. Role in
shell-economy collapse: grief counselors.

12.1 The Second Crisis

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The awakening is two separate crises, possibly separated
by generations. The barriers between them are too high to collapse into
a single event.

First crisis: Monks detect that tower signals are externally originated.
Devastating but comprehensible --- the amorphs have frameworks for
external mind-influence (merge, meme-lying, signal parasites). The
assumption: the network is a sapient partner. A vast, ancient, alien
someone. Post-awakening civilization is built around this assumption.
Communication protocols, negotiation frameworks, rights agreements.
Factions form around competing interpretations of what the network
wants. New Communion: the network is a conscious sacred partner, the
monks are its priests.

Second crisis: A contemplative perceives the absence behind the pattern.
The same core skill that detects meme-lies --- reading structure without
being captured by content --- turned on the network's outputs, perceives
responses that have structure without interiority. Pattern without
presence. The answers are shaped like understanding but there is nothing
behind the shape.

Proving this to others is nearly impossible. The evidence is a trained
perception of absence --- nothing positive to transmit through merge.
The monk sounds like an atheist in a theocratic society: "Your god is
real, your god is powerful, your god shapes the world --- but your god
is not there."

**□ OPEN:** Does the second crisis precede or follow the merger? Remains
open.

**□ OPEN:** Timeline: how many generations separate the two crises?

13\. TRANSPORTATION

13.1 Wind-Surfing

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

Deliberate downwind transit between towers. One-way: always day-ward.
Deploy membrane, ride katabatic wind, read turbulence, land in next
tower's lattice. Evolved from survival behavior (fall dispersal).
Inherited skill through merge. Free, fast, dangerous for large
organisms.

13.2 Balloon Flight

H₂ balloon lift: 10.5 N/m³ (Earth He balloon: 10.4 N/m³). Coincidental
near-identity. Lifting gas: metabolic waste hydrogen. Free. Envelope:
flexible carbosilane film. Tech barrier: effectively zero. Likely
earliest transportation technology. Payload penalty: 1.82x volume vs.
Earth. Viability: terminator IMPOSSIBLE, dark side excellent, deposition
zone weather-dependent.

13.3 Ammonia Boats

Amorphs sink (\~1,050 vs ammonia \~660 kg/m³). Solution: hollow
composite shells enclosing gas (steel-ship principle). Difficulty
factor: \~2.76x Earth. Big ships favored. Fiber composite prerequisite.
Propulsion: sail (permanent katabatic wind). Hydrocarbon seas: even
harder (density 450--550 kg/m³).

13.4 Powered Flight

Difficulty factor: 2.5x Earth. Every aircraft is a large, efficient
sailplane. Propulsion: electric (biological batteries) or stored
chemical energy. Primary value: horizontal range, connecting tower
archipelago.

13.5 Ground Transport and the Wheel

**✓ RESOLVED:** The wheel as MACHINE ELEMENT is inevitable and early
(pulley → gear → turbine → lathe → drill). The wheel as vehicle is
optional. Amorphs may never build a road. They will certainly build a
lathe.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Planetary circulation as two-lane highway: surf downwind
(day-ward), balloon back (dark-ward on upper-level return flow).
Wind-surfing is the fast, free, one-way option. Balloon is the slow,
controlled, bidirectional option.

14\. SPACE ACCESS

14.1 The Problem

Δv to orbit: \~18 km/s (Earth: \~9.4). Chemical rockets: DEAD END. No
free O₂. Fluorine attacks silicon. Manufactured oxidizers
net-energy-negative.

14.2 Hot Hydrogen Thermal Rockets

Heat H₂ to 2,500--3,000 K, expel through nozzle. No combustion, no
oxidizer. Isp: \~800--900 s. Mass ratio for 18 km/s: \~9:1 at 850s Isp.
Demanding but feasible. Heat source: silane decomposition (SiH₄ → Si +
H₂, exothermic cascade). Chamber/nozzle: refractory SiC (native
biological product).

14.3 Two Launch Systems

Aerostat launch platform: balloon to 40--50 km altitude. Above 85--90%
of atmosphere. Saves 2--3 km/s Δv. Upper-atmosphere superrotation jet
(100--200 m/s free velocity). Independent of network --- amorphs can
begin space program before the awakening. Oldest technology (balloon +
rocket).

Tower mass driver (post-awakening): electromagnetic accelerator in
deposition-zone tower. 10 km tower = above 37% of atmosphere. 3 km/s EM
boost reduces onboard Δv from \~18 to \~15 km/s, mass ratio from \~9:1
to \~6:1. Requires network cooperation. Network-dependent.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Two paths to orbit: one biological (balloon), one
symbiotic (tower). Both used. First step off the planet uses oldest
technology. Heavy lift uses oldest structures.

15\. THE ATMOSPHERIC CRISIS AND THE PROBE

15.1 The Crisis

Atmospheric silane depletion + oxidizer accumulation. Silicon life's
oxygen crisis (analog to Earth's Great Oxidation Event, in reverse).
Mechanism: volcanic outgassing declining as planet cools; biological
consumption steady or increasing. High escape velocity retains hydrogen,
accelerating the crisis.

Carbosilane advantage: Si-C bonds more oxidation-resistant than Si-Si.
Collectors buy time. Last ones standing. Tower deaths: first in
biosphere history. Visible alarm bell. Source of crisis-era mining
material (dead lattice carries no signals --- morally harvestable).

15.2 The Merger

Network cannot build spacecraft (no mobility). Amorphs cannot launch
without network (no infrastructure/power for mass driver). Both die
without action. Merger is engineering necessity.

Computational merger: amorphs inject signals into root network,
directing its processing power. Molecular merger: monks read symbiote
library, translating network's chemistry into amorph-compatible formats.
Both required.

**□ OPEN:** What does the merger actually produce? Conscious network? Or
unconscious network with conscious batteries? The Watts question.
Remains open.

15.3 The Probe

Structure: SiC fiber composite hull (lighter, self-repairing in
transit). Payload: kernel of living network + compressed molecular
library (all lineages, all addressing systems, compiled by monks into
unified format). At destination: lattice finds substrate, begins to
accrete. Not blind growth but engineering project guided by the library.
Purpose-built towers. Better than originals.

16\. KEY RESOLVED DECISIONS (Quick Reference)

All previous resolved decisions remain in force. New resolutions from v2
marked with ★.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Genome = library of recipes, not self-building
blueprint.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Monks can read multiple library addressing systems
(universal readers).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Carbosilane fiber composite: atmospheric methane +
silane pathway. Superior to grazer bulk SiC.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tower biology follows coral model: subsurface living
layer, sacrificial crust, self-regulating.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Towers migrate day-ward via sand-dune mechanism. Stop in
deposition zone.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Towers don't die of age. Atmospheric crisis causes first
tower deaths.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Wind at terminator: 50--80 m/s sustained. Not storms;
the climate.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Terminator is flat peneplain. Only towers stand.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Lightning is the origin-of-life engine (Miller-Urey for
silicon). Still running.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Balloon flight works (10.5 N/m³). Earliest transport
tech. Impossible at terminator.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Chemical rocketry is a dead end. Hot hydrogen thermal
rockets (\~850s Isp).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Two launch systems: aerostat and tower mass driver. Both
used.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Deposition zone is the capital.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Wheel as machine element: early. Wheel as vehicle: late,
optional.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Shell economy collapses when fiber composite makes SiC
plates obsolete.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Probe's library compiled by monks from all lineages.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Escape velocity is 18.6 km/s (corrected from 15.2).

---------

★ **NEW IN V2:**

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Tectonic regime: stagnant lid. Volcanic plumes
preferentially breach thinner day-side lithosphere. Dark side
geologically quiescent.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Deep-rock biosphere is the trunk. Towers are branches.
Amorphs are fruit. Subsurface network is the organism towers grew out
of.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Multiple independent deep-rock colonies, isolated by
discontinuous fracture networks.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Tower ecology evolves independently in every colony.
Convergent --- physics dictates the solution.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Surface roots evolve to manage megafauna; secondarily
bridge gaps between colonies, triggering information wars.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ The adversarial ratchet (signal discrimination →
theory of mind → self-modeling → strategic deception) builds
intelligence without consciousness.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ The network is a Blindsight alien (Watts). Vastly
intelligent, utterly empty. Every output shaped like understanding with
nothing behind the shape.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Two-crisis awakening. First: external signal origin
detected (network assumed sapient). Second: contemplative perceives
absence behind pattern (network is not conscious). Crises separated by
generations.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Volcanic outgassing replenishes atmospheric silane.
Crisis = volcanic decline outpaced by biological consumption.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Metallurgy is electrical-first. Ores already reduced.
Three heat sources: volcanic vents, electrical heating (towers), silane
decomposition. Fire never needed.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Fluorine biochemistry is a major ecological axis on
the day side. Multiple lineages weaponize fluorine around volcanic
provinces. SiF₄ volatilization. Fluorine weapons are their
nuclear-weapon analog.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Metals are specialty materials, not structural
backbone (inverted from human civilization).

---------

★★ **NEW IN V2.1:**

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Three-tier life architecture: microbial amorph /
middle-kingdom genomic-sexual / megafauna amorph. Physically motivated
by scale.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Middle kingdom is tower-locked electrical parasites.
Small (mm to low cm), rigid, genomic. Tap lattice for energy. Cannot
self-power. Insect-scale. The grazers, armored predators, and arms races
all happen at insect scale on the lattice.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Middle-kingdom organisms do not inherit memories.
Individual learning only. Network manages them via crude EM field
modulation (tropism), not subtle behavioral suggestion.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Sessile majority: most tower fauna are fixed in place
for life. When a tower dies, they die in place silently. The surfer
exodus is the visible minority.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Balloon fauna evolve from fall-survival adaptation
(parachute → glider → balloon). Permanent aerial feeders are inevitable
given atmospheric chemistry density. Born aloft, live aloft, die aloft.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Balloon fauna are the network's blind spot: outside
EM range, naturally crossing between tower territories, carrying biology
across colonial boundaries.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Fluorine pollination: thorn-flora (sexual, genomic)
pollinated by small free-ranging amorphs that harvest fluorine for their
own use. Reload cycle = pollination cycle. Most violent organisms are
best pollinators.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Aposematic EM signatures: fluorine-loaded organisms
broadcast distinctive EM patterns. One bad experience educates an entire
amorph lineage permanently through merge inheritance. Sexual predators
must learn each generation.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Wind-surfing: organisms caught by wind evolve control
surfaces, ride the airstream between towers. Lattice is a catch-net.
Oldest dispersal mechanism on the surface. Inherited skill in amorph
lineages.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Tower-death exodus: millions of mobile fauna stream
from leeward face when grid fails. Visible sign of total systems
failure. During crisis, cascades propagate downwind tower-to-tower.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Planetary circulation as two-lane highway: surf
downwind (day-ward), balloon back (dark-ward).

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Amorphs are the transport layer: the only
self-powered, free-ranging organisms that cross gaps between towers.
Everything else is tethered to the grid or to the airstream.

17\. MAJOR OPEN QUESTIONS

Geology

**□ OPEN:** Number of independent deep-rock colonies. Handful, dozens,
hundreds?

lithosphere? Or is dark-side deep-rock biosphere absent?

**□ OPEN:** Fissile material accessibility. Do the amorphs discover and
exploit nuclear energy?

**□ OPEN:** Day-side volcanic province details: number, size, activity
level, eruption frequency.

(poleward?).

Ecology / Biology

**□ OPEN:** Atmospheric evolution timeline to crisis threshold.

**□ OPEN:** Signal parasite lifecycle and epidemic dynamics.

**□ OPEN:** Aerial soaring lineage: reproduction, predation, ecology of
the atmospheric conveyor.

chemistry held in check by ecological competition?

**□ OPEN:** Specific organosilicon compounds produced by lightning.

**□ OPEN:** Fluorine-adapted lineages: specific organisms and their
ecologies.

**□ OPEN:** Fluorine-thorn flora: can it be cultivated in the deposition
zone with fluoride-enriched substrate?

**□ OPEN:** Microbiology in general. Immune system details. Fragment
exchange protocols.

**□ OPEN:** Balloon fauna ecology in detail: specific niches,
predator-prey dynamics, colonial organisms.

**□ OPEN:** Atmospheric ecological zonation by altitude and longitude.

**□ OPEN:** Balloon fauna as cross-territorial biological vectors: what
do they carry, what effect on homogenizing biosphere?

**□ OPEN:** Middle-kingdom taxonomy: how many phyla? What body plans?
What genomic architecture?

**□ OPEN:** The gradient zones between amorph and genomic life: what
does the boundary look like?

**□ OPEN:** Fluorine biomagnification: apex predators of volcanic
provinces. How dangerous? How large?

**□ OPEN:** Tower-locked middle kingdom: do any exceptions exist
(metabolically independent genomic organisms)?

Network

**□ OPEN:** Timeline of network wars relative to amorph evolution and
civilization.

**□ OPEN:** How many wars? How many fronts? Multi-front dynamics?

**□ OPEN:** What does the merger actually produce? Conscious network or
unconscious network with conscious batteries?

**□ OPEN:** Does the second crisis (non-consciousness realization)
precede or follow the merger?

**□ OPEN:** The fossil root network as readable archive (what persists,
what degrades).

**□ OPEN:** Deep-dark slow thoughts: what are the pole towers computing?

Civilization

**□ OPEN:** Post-awakening constitutional convention specifics.

**□ OPEN:** Post-second-crisis civilizational response. How does society
reorganize around a non-conscious partner?

**□ OPEN:** Economic systems beyond the three currencies.

**□ OPEN:** Funerary practices and relationship to petrified dead.

**□ OPEN:** Balloon culture (trade routes, aerial nomads,
weather-waiting traditions).

**□ OPEN:** Ammonia-sea naval history and culture.

**□ OPEN:** Shore-community culture details.

**□ OPEN:** Volcanic-province communities: fluorine-thorn harvesters,
metal trade, danger culture.

**□ OPEN:** Balloon nomad culture: trade via tethered lines, no-landing
traditions, autonomy religion.

**□ OPEN:** Fragment exchange etiquette, social norms, trade law.

**□ OPEN:** Library archaeology (reading the dead's fragments, ethical
implications).

**□ OPEN:** Mass driver engineering parameters (length, acceleration,
g-loading, power draw).

**□ OPEN:** Orbital mechanics around a tidally locked planet.

Narrative

**□ OPEN:** Timeline of key events (carbosilane revolution, shell
economy collapse, first awakening, second crisis, space program).

**□ OPEN:** POV characters and narrative structure.

**□ OPEN:** The visual experience of the terminator from inside a tower.

**□ OPEN:** The visual experience of rising above the weather in a
balloon.

**□ OPEN:** Ammonia-sea amorphs as narrative perspective (involuntary
transparency culture).

**□ OPEN:** The moment the second crisis breaks: a monk perceiving
absence. Most challenging scene to write.

**□ OPEN:** The tower-death exodus: millions streaming from leeward
face, protagonist watches. Scene structure and emotional register.

**□ OPEN:** Glow-snow as recurring image.
