## 1. Summary of Derived Shape

**Cross-section (plan view):** Symmetric airfoil. Blunt convex windward face, maximum thickness at ~20–30% chord, tapering to narrow trailing edge with chimney vent openings. The windward face is a vaulted arch in the cross-wind direction (convex toward wind), providing structural efficiency via membrane compression.

**Vertical profile:** Tapered. Wide and deep at the base (structural buttress + root anchorage). Narrower and shallower with height. The top approaches a thin curved filter membrane — a broad ridge with a gentle central peak.

**Conceptual metaphor:** A vertical airfoil. Not a column. The tower is a thin curved wall, not a solid cylinder. "A thin membrane held up by an arch."

**Regional continuum:** Airfoil (terminator, high wind) → teardrop (near dark side) → circular dome (anti-stellar, no wind). Shape is a continuous function of local wind speed.

## 2. Tower Construction Model

This section is foundational. The tower's shape cannot be understood without understanding how towers are built.

### 2.1 The tower has no genome

The tower is not an organism. It has no genes, no body plan, no construction blueprint. It cannot plan ahead. It responds to local, real-time measurements: compressive stress, wind force, material intake rate, electrical potential gradients. All it can control is what gets deposited (or destroyed) next, at its current exterior surface.

Once lattice is ceramified (SiC/SiCN), it is permanent. The tower cannot un-ceramify material. It CAN, however, destroy ceramified material using the same arc tool used for construction (see §2.4).

### 2.2 Growth phases over deep time

**Phase 1 — Autocatalytic mineral accretion.** Pre-symbiote. The proto-tower's N:SiC surface is catalytic (N:SiC surface chemistry provides Lewis base sites from nitrogen dopant; N-doping from atmospheric NH₃ is automatic, so every new layer is catalytic). Lightning forges heavy molecules (PCS, complex organosilicon) from atmospheric SiH₄, CH₄, NH₃. Hypercyclic catalytic reactions on the tower surface assemble these into more lattice. The new surface is itself catalytic — the reaction front self-propagates **in all directions** where catalytic surface, feedstock, and energy coexist. The proto-tower is a mineral deposit shaped by physics: reactant flux (wind direction), energy input (lightning), and reaction geometry. No biology involved.

**Phase 1 root genesis.** The catalytic surface reaction grows isotropically — it doesn't distinguish vertical from lateral. Vertical growth dominates early due to height-lightning feedback (taller = more strikes = more energy). But the same reaction extends laterally along exposed deep-rock fracture traces at the monadnock base. This lateral component accelerates via a **resistance crossover**: lightning I²R heating progressively ceramifies the PCS gap from above, but each new increment of ceramified column adds series resistance (power at the downward front ∝ 1/R²_total). The downward front stalls after ~1–5 km. Lateral surface paths through exposed N:SiC fracture traces don't accumulate comparable resistance (short paths, spreading geometry). By Kirchhoff's laws, current redistributes from the stalling downward path to lateral paths, feeding more I²R energy to the lateral catalytic growth fronts. The result: a **pre-biotic proto-root network** — dendritic, fracture-following, shaped by current flow patterns. Crude but conductive and grounding-functional. Root growth IS tower growth, laterally redirected by the progressive electrical failure of the fracture grounding path. The spine's "roots evolved to sink excess power" is literally true: the tower has charge that can no longer go down, so it goes sideways.

**Phase 2 — Symbiote colonization.** Aeroplankton reach the tower. Symbiotes tap grid power and process SiH₄ for their own metabolism. But the tower's bulk growth is still the catalytic reaction front. The symbiotes are tenants — and initially parasites from the tower's growth perspective, since they sit on the catalytic surface and consume SiH₄ that would otherwise feed the reaction.

**Phase 3 — Mutualism and the reef transition.** Miners deliver catalytic metals that accelerate the reaction. Healers evolve for surface repair (arc-CVD). But repair behaviors and construction behaviors are the same chemistry. A Healer that can patch a crack can extend a strut. Selection pressure via energy-gradient tropism: Healer lineages whose deposition patterns produce better tower architecture → better tower function → network feeds them more → those genomes spread. Over Gyr, Healer genomes accumulate architectural information that the tower itself cannot carry. The tower transitions from a mineral deposit shaped by physics to a biological construction shaped by symbiote genomes — a reef, a termite mound. The original autocatalytic reaction is dead in modern towers — Healer arc-CVD deposits non-catalytic SiCN over the original catalytic N:SiC surface, and Ship of Theseus renewal (§2.5) replaces all original material. The catalytic surface cannot restart; the dependence on symbiotes is absolute and irreversible.

### 2.3 The symbiote genome as tower construction program

The tower's "genome" is distributed across its symbiote species:

- **Healer genomes** encode: where to deposit, when to ceramify, what density to build, how to respond to local stress signals. Healers are both builders and demolition crews.
- **Miner genomes** encode: what metals to deliver where, how to distribute catalytic feedstock.
- **Guard genomes** encode: quality control — which Healer work gets tolerated, which gets stripped.
- **Network behavioral patterns** encode: energy-gradient modulation that shapes which surfaces get fed and which get starved. Evolved over Gyr for optimal tower architecture.

Together, symbiote genomes + network patterns constitute an effective construction program. The tower is the product. The symbiotes are the builders carrying the blueprints. The network is the project manager.

**Modern roots are Healer-maintained and extended.** In mature towers, Healers perform root construction and maintenance via arc-CVD directed along network energy gradients.

**✓ RESOLVED: Pre-Healer root mechanism.** Roots are the lateral component of Phase 1 autocatalytic growth (§2.2), amplified by the resistance crossover as the downward PCS gap ceramification front stalls. Pre-biotic, pre-symbiote. Healers inherit and optimize an extant root system — they accelerate and direct root construction via arc-CVD, but do not invent it.

### 2.4 Additive AND subtractive manufacturing

Healers possess an arc tool. With CVD feedstock: construction (deposit new SiCN). Without feedstock: destruction (arc-vaporize existing SiC at ~2700°C). Same tool, two modes.

This gives the tower subtractive capability:
- Remove ceramified structure that is structurally suboptimal
- Carve chimney channels through solid lattice
- Excavate amorph habitat chambers
- Demolish and rebuild sections for progressive renovation
- **Reprogram signal-processing topology** — the lattice geometry IS the computation (every junction, pore, conductive path = circuit element). Adding/removing structure modifies the circuit. The tower is an FPGA; Healers are the programming interface. The network reprograms its own computational substrate in real time.

**Practical constraint:** Arc destruction costs energy. At the terminator (surplus power from lightning + piezoelectric + solar), this is not a meaningful constraint. On the deep dark side (energy-poor), demolition is expensive and renovation is rare.

### 2.5 Ship of Theseus: progressive in-situ replacement

Old or suboptimal towers are not toppled or abandoned. They are replaced section by section, in situ. Healers arc-destroy a strut, re-deposit the material as new lattice with proper signal infrastructure, move to the next strut. The SiC never leaves the site. Zero transport. Zero waste. The only cost is arc energy — surplus at the terminator.

The replacement front can work upward from the foundation. Below the front: new tower with proper signal-compatible lattice. Above: old tower being consumed. The tower remains functional throughout. Progressive replacement over centuries or millennia.

**Consequence: there are no old towers on the mature network.** Every tower position is ancient (fixed at nucleation). Every tower's material has been progressively renewed. The lattice in any given tower might be centuries old or recently replaced, but nothing dates to the original catalytic-accretion era. It has all been recycled through Healer construction.

The tower is immortal in the way a river is immortal: the position persists, the substance flows through it.

### 2.6 Tower aliveness spectrum

Towers exist on a spectrum, not as binary alive/dead:

| State | Symbiotes | Catalytic surface | Growth | Network | Architecture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full reef** | Active population, all guilds | Dead (buried under Healer deposits) | Healer-directed | Connected, managed | Optimized airfoil |
| **Degraded reef** | Reduced population, patchy | Possibly re-exposed in gaps | Mixed: Healer + crude catalytic | Connected but weakening | Deteriorating |
| **Reaction front only** | None or negligible | Active (exposed to atmosphere) | Crude autocatalytic accretion | Disconnected (no Healer root maintenance) | Primitive mound |
| **Inert** | None | Dead (passivated) | None | Disconnected | Fossil — permanent ceramics |

During the atmospheric crisis, towers degrade through this spectrum as SiH₄ drops and symbiote metabolism slows. The architecture degrades before the structure does.

**⚠ Modern towers skip "reaction front only" during degradation.** Ship of Theseus has replaced all original catalytic N:SiC with non-catalytic Healer SiCN. There is no catalytic surface to revert to. A modern tower losing its Healers goes directly from degraded reef to inert. The "reaction front only" state exists only for Phase 1 towers that never received symbiotes — geological isolates with original ancient material (§2.7).

**Signal-processing states (FPGA model):** Active FPGA (Healers present, network-connected — full signal processing). Frozen processor (no Healers, stale firmware — signals still flow through if root-connected, but circuit topology is static). Isolated processor (disconnected — no input signals, not incapable).

### 2.7 Convergent architecture

Given geological time, the entire tower forest converges on the current best architecture for each location. Every accessible tower has been Ship-of-Theseus replaced by the same symbiote lineage using the same network management patterns. Regional variation reflects local conditions (wind, power, feedstock), not evolutionary history. The architectural fossil record is erased.

Towers from absorbed rival networks (assimilated during network wars) may have initially shown different architectural styles, but have long since been replaced with the current network's construction program.

The only towers with original ancient material would be those geologically isolated from the network — never reached by roots. These would be mineral mounds from the catalytic-accretion era: unremodeled, unconnected. Geological curiosities, not functional towers.

## 3. Filtration: Why an Airfoil?

### 3.1 The tower's primary function

The tower exists to intercept particulate-laden wind and extract building materials + SiH₄ feedstock. The windward face is the intake. Air passes THROUGH the porous lattice, not around it. Every strut surface inside the lattice is a collection site for particulate and a gas-exchange surface for SiH₄ metabolism.

### 3.2 Functional depth: 2–3 m

From Fauna Structural Hub §9.7: the living zone occupies ~2–3 m depth from the windward face. After ~450 strut layers (at ~5 mm strut spacing), both particulate grit and SiH₄ are depleted from the through-flow. The five flow zones (windward face, transitional, core, transitional, leeward) are compressed into this 2–3 m envelope. Beyond it: stagnant, depleted.

This is the extraction-depth limit. Additional material behind this zone does not perform the primary function — it is structural and chimney infrastructure.

### 3.3 Symbiotic fauna amplify both capture and drag

Tower-coupled organisms (Healers, Miners, Guards) occupy the windward pore zone. **Symbiotes coat strut surfaces, not plug pores.** Organisms living on a ~2 mm strut inside a 6–12 mm pore increase the effective strut diameter (to ~4–6 mm with biological layer) and reduce the pore opening, but do not seal it. Wind still passes through. The 80–85% bulk opacity arises from the combined lattice geometry plus biological coating across ~450 partially-obstructed layers in series — no single layer is sealed. A dead tower (no symbiotes) is significantly more wind-transparent than a living one.

Symbiote bodies are additional collection surfaces and their metabolic activity processes captured material. This increases effective capture efficiency per unit depth. However, organisms in pores also increase drag (partially occluding pore throats, increasing flow resistance). More organisms = better capture but higher wind loading per unit frontal area. The equilibrium balances these.

### 3.4 Why not circular?

A circular cross-section wastes material. The downwind half has no fresh wind passing through it — SiH₄ depleted, particulate filtered. The back half is structural deadweight from a filtration standpoint.

Healer-directed growth optimizes for feeding: deposit where it captures food, don't deposit where it doesn't. This produces a cross-section where the windward-facing shell is the functional zone and everything behind it serves structural or chimney functions only.

### 3.5 Why an airfoil and not a flat plate?

A flat plate perpendicular to the wind is structurally untenable at km scale in 1.82g under 370 Pa sustained load. Zero bending stiffness in the wind direction. Would fail by overturning.

The airfoil shape provides wind-axis depth at the center:
- Bending resistance against wind load (moment of inertia scales as D³)
- Structural anchorage for the root system (base buttresses extend leeward)
- Chimney conduit (interior cavity for H₂ venting)

The curvature of the windward face (convex toward wind) converts wind pressure into membrane compression along the arch — structurally efficient for SiC, which is strong in compression.

### 3.6 Why not a wedge or flat-front shape?

A flat windward face creates flow separation at the edges, losing particulate to turbulent wake zones on the flanks. A curved (convex) windward face wraps flow around the flanks smoothly, with the entire curved surface acting as collection area.

The Healer deposition pattern converges on this shape: maximum deposition rate at center of windward face (highest particle flux), decreasing along flanks (decreasing flux), minimal at the trailing edge (no particle flux, chimney vent function). This gradient naturally produces the airfoil taper.

---

## 4. Gas Exchange and Chimney Function

### 4.1 SiH₄ advection through the lattice

Wind at 9.5 m/s entering the porous lattice decelerates through successive strut layers. Pore-scale velocity at the face is ~10 m/s (Re ≈ 31,000 per strut). SiH₄ (0.3% atmospheric = 2,400 Pa partial pressure at 8 bar) is consumed by symbiote metabolism at each strut surface.

SiH₄ concentration profile is approximately exponential decay: C(x) = C₀ × exp(−x/λ), where λ ≈ 0.5–1 m (concentration drops to ~5% of inlet at 2–3 m depth). Matches the particulate-depletion depth — the biology has had Gyr to optimize so both resources exhaust at the same depth.

### 4.2 H₂ waste and the chimney

Core metabolism: SiH₄ → SiC + 2H₂. Hydrogen is inert waste.

H₂ density at 8 bar, 240K: ρ_H₂ = PM/(RT) = **0.80 kg/m³**
Atmospheric density: **8.2 kg/m³**
Buoyancy: Δρ × g = (8.2 − 0.80) × 17.85 = **132 Pa per metre of H₂ column height**
Wind dynamic pressure: **370 Pa**

A 3 m H₂ column generates buoyancy equal to the wind's dynamic pressure. Over km-scale height, the chimney draft is orders of magnitude stronger than wind. The tower interior is an active chimney.

### 4.3 Venturi-enhanced venting

Wind past the trailing edge creates a low-pressure zone. The airfoil taper to chimney vents produces Venturi suction, pulling gas upward and outward. Selection favors trailing-edge geometry that maximizes draft.

### 4.4 Trailing-edge vent geometry

**Discrete Healer-built vent openings, concentrated in the upper tower, sparse-to-absent at the base.**

- **Base (0–50 m):** Solid trailing edge. Maximum structural integrity needed for overturning resistance. Gas at ground level goes up, not out.
- **Mid-height:** Sparse, small vents. Some Venturi-assisted gas bleed. Structural webbing still connects flanks.
- **Upper tower:** Large, frequent vents. Maximum accumulated gas flow exits here. Structural loads minimal. Vent geometry shaped by Healer genomes for Venturi efficiency — nozzle-like (narrowing outward).
- **Apex:** Primary chimney exhaust is straight up through the top, not through trailing-edge vents.

The trailing-edge vents are secondary exhaust — Venturi-assisted pressure relief along the height. The primary exhaust exits upward through the apex.

### 4.5 Chimney phases: growth vs maturity

**Genesis/early-growth towers:** The chimney draws SiH₄ from the subsurface vent — wind-powered pump for the deep-rock system. H₂ column managed lightning targeting for ceramification.

**Mature towers:** Whole-body electrical potential management handles lightning. Chimney vents H₂ waste but is no longer the dominant shape constraint. Filter function and structural requirements dominate.

## 5. Structural Analysis

### 5.1 Material properties

| Property | Value | Source / Note |
|---|---|---|
| SiC bulk density | 3,210 kg/m³ | Standard |
| Aerogel solids fraction | 5–10% (assumed) | "Mostly void." Not canonized. |
| Bulk aerogel density | 160–320 kg/m³ | At 5–10% |
| SiC compressive strength | ~3,900 MPa | Standard 3C-SiC |
| SiC Young's modulus | ~400 GPa | Standard 3C-SiC |

### 5.2 Aerogel mechanical scaling

Gibson-Ashby scaling: σ_eff = C × σ_s × (ρ/ρ_s)^n

For random foams: n ≈ 1.5–2. For biologically optimized lattice (Gyr of selection): n ≈ 1–1.5. Using n = 1.5 (conservative):

| Solids fraction | Effective compressive strength | Effective modulus |
|---|---|---|
| 5% | ~9 MPa | ~1.3 GPa |
| 10% | ~25 MPa | ~3.8 GPa |

### 5.3 Maximum height from self-weight compression

At 5% solids: H_max = σ_eff / (ρ_bulk × g) = 9 × 10⁶ / (160 × 17.85) ≈ **3,100 m**

Tapering extends this by 50–70%. **Km-scale towers are structurally feasible.**

### 5.4 Overturning resistance

For a 1 km tower, 100 m wide: required base depth D_base > **~43 m**. The base must have substantial wind-axis depth for overturning stability, far exceeding the 2–3 m functional filter depth. The base is dominated by structural buttressing.

Bending stress at the base (~60 kPa) is negligible vs aerogel strength (9 MPa). **Self-weight compression governs maximum height; overturning governs minimum base depth.**

### 5.5 Growth history and progressive renovation

The tower's structure reflects its construction history. Ceramified lattice is permanent — but Healers can arc-destroy and rebuild it (§2.4).

**Initial construction:** When a tower is young and short, Healers build light, porous lattice optimized for feeding (low compressive stress, no reason to build heavy). As the tower grows taller, the base carries more load. But the base was built when the tower was short.

**Progressive renovation:** Healers at the base feel high compressive stress (via local measurement). Their genomes encode "deposit dense lattice under high stress" — selected over Gyr because Healer lineages that didn't build strong bases lived on towers that collapsed. The network directs energy to base renovation. Healers arc-destroy weak old struts and rebuild them denser. This is Ship of Theseus at the component level.

**At the terminator (surplus energy):** Renovation is unlimited. Every terminator tower has been progressively upgraded to structural optimality. Base density is whatever the Healer construction program produces under current loading — not limited by growth history.

**On the dark side (energy-poor):** Renovation is expensive. Dark-side towers are more constrained by growth history. Their bases may retain original light construction, limiting height.

### 5.6 Height-dependent cross-section profile

| Height zone | Wind-axis depth D | Cross-wind width W | Governing constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base (0–50 m) | 30–50 m | 100–200+ m | Overturning stability, root anchorage |
| Lower (50–200 m) | 15–30 m | 80–150 m | Compression taper |
| Mid (200–500 m) | 8–15 m | 50–100 m | Compression taper |
| Upper (500–1000 m) | 3–8 m | 20–60 m | Functional filter + minimal structure |
| Apex | 3–5 m | 10–30 m | Filter ridge, lightning collection |

Order-of-magnitude estimates for a ~1 km terminator tower.

**Shape vocabulary:** The base is a deep, wide buttressed arch — almost a mound, merging smoothly into the root system like tree-trunk root flares. The tower transitions upward into an increasingly thin wall-like profile. At the top, it is a curved porous blade. Overall silhouette: Gothic cathedral buttress — wide base sweeping up to a thin ridge.

### 5.7 Wind-axis depth partitioning (above the base)

| Zone | Depth | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Windward shell | 2–3 m | Active filter/lung. Living zone. All symbiote biology. |
| Interior void | 0–10 m (height-dependent) | Chimney conduit. H₂ venting. Structural webbing. Amorph habitat. |
| Leeward taper | 0.5–2 m | Trailing edge. Chimney vents (upper tower). Structural closure. |

Interior architecture: irregular vertical chimney channels separated by solid structural webbing. Shaped by chimney self-selection (same mechanism as deep-rock: surface-connected channels stay open via draft; dead-end pockets fill solid). No megafauna-scale excavated chambers (see §13 Q2, Q9 — tower immune system + reverence meme prevent internal excavation). Access via leeward vents (upper tower) and base openings (root-level gaps). Amorphs live externally in root-buttress interstices and amorph-built structures (see Industrialization Hub).

### 5.8 Apex geometry

**Broad ridge with gentle central peak.**

The tower top is a thin blade (3–5 m deep, 20–60 m wide). The apex is a horizontal ridge along the cross-wind axis:
- Maximum filter frontal area (ridge = line, point = zero area)
- Distributed lightning strikes along the ridge (vs dangerous current concentration at a single point)
- Primary chimney exhaust opening runs along the ridge

The central peak emerges from growth patterns — the center of the windward face has the highest SiH₄/particulate flux (stagnation zone), so Healer-directed growth is fastest there. No sharp spike needed — mature towers handle lightning through whole-body potential management regardless of strike location.

### 5.9 Network regulation of cross-wind width

Two mechanisms operate simultaneously:

**Local (no network input):** Flanks of the windward arch receive increasingly oblique wind. Particle flux and SiH₄ delivery per unit area drop with angle from stagnation center. At some width, marginal feeding return falls below symbiote maintenance cost. Growth self-limits. Soft maximum from local physics.

**Network (active management):** If tower A's flank shadows tower B's windward face, tower B's reduced intake → reduced network contribution → network reduces energy supply to tower A's flanks → Healer activity declines → growth stops there. Evolved behavioral response to reduced regional network performance. No understanding required.

Because towers are porous, wind shadowing is partial (most air goes through, not around). The shadow is a reduced-velocity plume, not a dead zone. Towers can pack closer than solid-body analysis would suggest. Fibonacci spacing is optimized for signal coverage (ping-latency), with shadowing as a secondary constraint managed by network energy modulation.

---

## 6. Towers Are Stationary

### 6.1 Wind cannot erode the tower

At v2.4 conditions (9.5 m/s, q = 370 Pa), aerogel strut strength (~20 MPa) exceeds wind-borne impact forces by 4–5 orders of magnitude. Only micro-scale pitting occurs. Healer repair completely negates pitting. Net erosion is zero.

### 6.2 Implications

- Towers nucleate at permanent positions via Fibonacci spacing rules.
- Tower populations at the deposition zone nucleated there via root network expansion, not migration.
- "Ghost roots" are the root network, not migration trails.

---

## 7. Porosity Profile

### 7.1 Windward-to-leeward gradient

| Region | Porosity | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Windward face (outer 0–0.5 m) | Moderate (~90%) | Dense enough to capture particles, open enough for airflow. Symbiote-occupied pores partially occluded. |
| Windward shell (0.5–2 m) | Higher (~93–95%) | Interior filter zone. Less particle impact, more gas exchange. |
| Living zone edge (2–3 m) | Highest (~95%+) | Transition to structural lattice. Last SiH₄ consumed. |
| Interior void | Variable | Mix of chimney conduits, structural webbing, amorph chambers. |
| Leeward taper/vent | Moderate (~90%) | Structural closure. Vent geometry for Venturi. |

### 7.2 Height gradient

- **Base:** Densest (~10–15% solid). High compressive loading. Healer renovation over Gyr has upgraded original light construction to structural optimum.
- **Mid-height:** Standard aerogel (~5–8% solid).
- **Top:** Lightest feasible (~3–5% solid). Minimum structure for filtration + lightning conduction. Youngest lattice.

At the terminator (surplus energy), the height gradient reflects full Healer optimization. On the dark side (energy-poor), the gradient reflects growth history more than renovation — base may retain original lighter construction.

---

## 8. Power Gradient and Regional Variation

### 8.1 Terminator energy surplus

A terminator tower has power surplus from three sources, all of which are just electricity to a piezoelectric semiconductor:

- **Lightning:** Continuous thunderstorm. Massive input.
- **Vibration:** 9.5 m/s sustained wind + volcanic micro-tremors on piezoelectric lattice.
- **Solar:** Star peak at 850 nm matches Si bandgap. Windward face is a solar panel.

The tower's problem at the terminator is managing *excess* power. Healer renovation and construction are energy-unconstrained.

### 8.2 Geographic power gradient

| Location | Power sources | Budget | Renovation capacity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terminator | Lightning + piezo + solar | Surplus | Unlimited — fully optimized architecture |
| Near dark side | Piezo (reduced) + some solar | Adequate | Moderate renovation |
| Deep dark side | Piezo (minimal) | Scarce | Minimal — growth-history-constrained |
| Anti-stellar | Near-zero | Minimal | Almost none — most primitive modern architecture |
| **Geothermal oasis** | **Geothermal (vent heat)** | **Surplus** | **Terminator-class despite dark-side location** |

### 8.3 Geothermal oasis towers

A dark-side tower on a geothermal vent with a SiH₄ pocket has terminator-class power and feedstock in an energy desert. Architecturally refined. Tall. Thriving symbiote population. Major network node. Anomalously sophisticated for its location.

Non-renewable: fossil SiH₄ pocket depletes. When exhausted, the tower degrades through the aliveness spectrum (§2.6). The architectural record betrays the ghost of a depleted pocket — a dark-side tower that's "too good" for its location.

These are the gas-pocket towers that eventually become monk monasteries (a later institutional development — the monk contemplative tradition originates on ordinary unpatched dark-side nodes; see Spine §MONKS, Warfare Hub §6.4).

### 8.4 Regional shape continuum

| Location | Wind | Shape | Aspect ratio (W:D) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Terminator (θ=90°) | 9.5 m/s | Sharp airfoil. Tallest. Best Venturi. | 5:1 to 10:1 |
| Near dark (θ≈110°) | ~7 m/s | Blunter airfoil. | ~3:1 to 5:1 |
| Mid dark (θ≈135°) | ~4 m/s | Teardrop trending toward oval. Thicker filter. | ~2:1 to 3:1 |
| Deep dark (θ≈160°) | ~1–2 m/s | Nearly circular. No meaningful trailing edge. | ~1:1 to 2:1 |
| Anti-stellar (θ→180°) | ~0 m/s | Circular dome. Chimney by thermal convection. | 1:1 |

Wind velocity: v(θ) = v_term × (sin θ)^(−1/4), θ = angular distance from substellar point.

As wind decreases, the Venturi trailing edge loses purpose. Chimney vents migrate from the trailing edge to the apex (upward venting via buoyancy only). The airfoil cross-section smoothly transitions to circular. Filter zone thickens (slower advection → longer extraction path → SiH₄ penetrates deeper).

Day-side towers (θ < 60°) are unlikely — volcanism + rain stripping kills them.

---

## 9. Derived Properties

### 9.1 Acoustic character and shadow geometry

**The tower voice is layered, not tonal.**

The windward shell (2–3 m active biological zone) does NOT produce clean Aeolian tones. Symbiotes coat the ~2 mm struts, increasing effective diameter to ~4–6 mm and creating irregular, soft biological surfaces. This damps vortex shedding. The windward shell generates **broadband biological noise** — turbulent flow through irregularly-coated pore channels. Think: rushing wind through dense wet forest, not a tuning fork.

Clean Aeolian tones (~1 kHz from bare 2 mm struts, St ≈ 0.2, v ≈ 10 m/s) are generated in the **interior structural webbing** behind the living shell, where struts are bare SiCN and the reduced-velocity throughflow (15–20% of freestream) passes through clean geometry. These tones are quieter than the windward broadband, but spectrally pure. From inside the tower, this is the tower's "voice" — a tonal hum behind the rush.

Additional acoustic components:
- **Low-frequency structural vibration** from wind loading on the whole tower body.
- **Chimney draft hiss** — H₂-rich updraft through vertical channels. Lower-frequency, varying with wind conditions.
- **Trailing-edge noise** from chimney vents. Dominates leeward soundscape.

**A dead tower sounds completely different.** No biological coating → bare struts throughout → clean Aeolian tones from every surface. Louder throughflow (no biological obstruction). No biological noise. The monks in their dead towers hear a different instrument — pure, resonant, crystalline. This is the acoustic environment in which monk tower-tuning develops as an art form.

**Acoustic shadow:**
- **Shadow zone:** Leeward side shielded from windward broadband and interior tones. Sharp acoustic boundary at flanks (geometric at ~1 kHz: λ ≈ 0.37 m, diffraction around 100 m tower negligible).
- **Shadow fill:** Low frequencies (structural vibration, chimney tones) fill in faster. High frequencies remain shadowed.
- **Leeward soundscape:** Low-frequency chimney noise + attenuated interior tones. The "filtered chord" zone.
- **Ecology:** Subwoofer predators exploit the shadow boundary (Fauna Hub §6).

### 9.2 EM antenna pattern

**Low frequency (λ >> tower):** Electrically small. Poor antenna. Incomplete Faraday shielding.

**Mid frequency (λ ~ tower width):** Gain broadside (along cross-wind axis). Null in wind direction (edge-on to thin profile).

**High frequency (λ << tower):** Complex multi-lobe. Overall: most sensitive broadside, systematic blind spots in wind direction.

**Key result:** Systematic EM blind spot in wind direction (upwind and downwind). Maximum sensitivity perpendicular to wind. Fibonacci array partially compensates via offset neighbors. Wind-axis blind spots are tactically exploitable in grid warfare (see Warfare Hub §6.3–6.4).

### 9.3 Lattice flow zones mapped to airfoil

The 5-zone model (Fauna Structural Hub §9.7) maps onto the airfoil windward shell without modification:

| Zone | Location on airfoil |
|---|---|
| Windward face | Leading edge / central windward surface |
| Pore throat | Between strut layers through the 2–3 m shell |
| Leeward face | Inner surface of struts facing away from wind |
| Junction pocket | Strut junctions throughout shell |
| Deep interior | Beyond living zone — chimney conduit |

No revision to the 5-zone model needed. Defined at strut scale, independent of macroscopic cross-section.

**Note on "deep interior":** The interior serves active chimney function (H₂ venting, buoyancy-driven draft) and contains amorph habitat (chambers, passages). Functionally important — not empty dead lattice.

## 10. Tower Distribution and Network Spacing

### 10.1 Spacing model

Tower spacing is determined by network signal optimization — root attenuation, latency, and EM coverage. Towers are creatures of the network; the network builds them where it needs nodes. Spacing is an information-architecture problem, not an ecology or resource-competition problem.

**Fibonacci phyllotaxis:** Towers are arranged in a golden-angle (~137.5°) pattern, giving ~6 neighbors per tower. This prevents wind-axis row alignment, which would create correlated EM blind spots (§9.2). The pattern is set at nucleation and maintained by preferential-feeding tropism — the network under-feeds positions that are too close (redundant coverage) and over-feeds gaps (latency holes).

**Two-speed signal model:** Tower body = FPGA processing with gate delays (~10³–10⁴ m/s effective signal velocity). Roots = transmission lines with electrical propagation (~10⁸ m/s in N:SiC, ε_r ≈ 9.7). Root signal attenuation in N-doped SiC (ρ ≈ 0.01–0.1 Ω·cm) with ~10 cm cross-section gives ~10–20 km unboosted range. This root attenuation sets the maximum useful tower spacing.

**Superconductors:** Never achieved by the network. Biological CVD lacks the crystallographic precision required for BCS-type superconductor fabrication. Late development in civilized-amorph industrial tech tree. The network is permanently limited by normal semiconductor root attenuation.

### 10.2 Spacing by region

| Zone | Spacing | Binding constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Terminator (θ=90°) | ~6.5 km | Root signal range |
| Near dark (θ≈110°) | ~8–10 km | Root signal range |
| Mid dark (θ≈135°) | ~12–15 km | EM coverage |
| Deep dark (θ≈160°) | ~20 km | EM coverage |
| Anti-stellar (θ→180°) | >20 km | Thermal convection only |

Cross-wind blockage at terminator spacing: ~3% (tower chord ~200 m at 6.5 km intervals). The forest is effectively transparent to wind.

### 10.3 Interaction with atmospheric circulation

**Non-binding constraints:** Towers are lightning-powered (not wind-powered) at the terminator. Mature towers are net-zero on materials (intake ≈ waste; Ship-of-Theseus renovation recycles). SiH₄ is superabundant (0.3% atmospheric). Energy, materials, and SiH₄ are all non-binding on spacing.

**Aerodynamic drag:** The forest collectively imposes ~4× smooth-surface friction in the terminator belt (tower drag vs smooth-surface friction over the same area). Physically real but ecologically irrelevant — does not constrain tower viability or density.

**Material conveyor:** Global particulate conveyor (day-side volcanism → chimney → superstream → anti-stellar downdraft → katabatic surface flow) operates independently of the forest. Conveyor saturates at atmospheric carrying capacity. Towers are flow-through (SiH₄ in, SiC dust + H₂ out). No engineered channels needed.

### 10.4 Feedback mechanisms

Three feedback loops identified at equilibrium:

1. **Preferential-feeding self-regulation (dominant).** The network modulates tower growth via energy distribution. Under-feeds redundant positions, over-feeds gaps. Converges on Fibonacci spacing because it simultaneously optimizes signal coverage, latency, EM pattern, and energy efficiency.

2. **Peneplain stability lock.** Dead-bug plume (SiC, Mohs 9.5) contributes to katabatic wind abrasive load, polishing dark-side bedrock over Gyr. Polished surface prevents new tower nucleation (no root purchase). Existing pattern frozen — can extend at edges, fill dead-tower gaps, but cannot reorganize interior.

3. **Death cascade (crisis-mode only).** Tower death → refugee overload → neighbor death → propagates day-ward (downwind). Requires external forcing (atmospheric SiH₄ decline). Not operative at equilibrium.

No destabilizing feedback loops at equilibrium. No resource-competition feedback. Spacing constrained entirely by information architecture.

### 10.5 Open: alternative spacing model

⚠ The current model assumes network topology (coverage, latency) drives spacing. An alternative — towers maximized for power population rather than network coverage — would produce different spacing under different rules. Current working assumption: network topology is the driver.

### 10.6 Mechanical karst and sinkhole defense

**[NEW V2.4+]**

**The problem:** Ammonia rain at the terminator produces runoff. Surface drainage is routed outward by root ridges (SiC roots resist erosion; silicate bedrock between them does not). Runoff percolates into the pre-fractured monadnock bedrock beneath the tower — the same fracture network created by the deep-rock reaction front. This runoff carries SiC grit (dead-bug plume debris, atmospheric particulate). SiC grit in ammonia flow mechanically abrades silicate fracture walls — a process analogous to limestone karst on Earth, but mechanical erosion rather than chemical dissolution.

**The fracture network is densest directly under the tower** (where the deep-rock reaction front originated). Maximum subterranean flow, maximum erosion, maximum sinkhole risk — exactly where it matters most.

**SiCN-lined root channels resist erosion** (SiC-on-SiC, same hardness). Flow preferentially widens *unlined* fractures adjacent to roots. Over geological time, voids develop in the silicate bedrock between root-armored channels. Eventually: sinkhole collapse.

**Tower defense: ammonia intrusion as signal.** Root contact with liquid ammonia where none existed before = void detected. Conductivity change in the root network triggers Healer dispatch to seal the breach with SiCN. Response time is the critical variable: a small crack with a trickle seals easily. An established flow channel carrying abrasive slurry erodes walls faster than Healers can coat them. Detection fast, seal fast, never let flow establish.

**Selection pressure:** Towers with better sinkhole detection (denser subterranean root monitoring) and faster Healer sealing survived. Towers that responded too slowly to ammonia intrusion collapsed from beneath over geological time. The response is now highly optimized — which is why towers persist at geological timescales despite the continuous erosion threat.

**Consequence: progressive underground SiCN armoring.** The tower continuously deposits SiCN underground to seal voids as they develop. Over geological time, the monadnock beneath a mature tower is increasingly replaced by tower-deposited ceramic — a geological Ship of Theseus. The composite of silicate remnants and SiCN void-fill is conductive (mappable), structurally reliable, and resistant to further erosion.

**Sinkhole defense also builds grounding capacity.** Underground SiCN provides conductive paths to ground — supplementing the surface root network's grounding function. No conflict with surface roots: surface roots developed first (grounding is an immediate Phase 1 need; ammonia intrusion is situational/intermittent). By the time underground SiCN provides significant grounding capacity, surface roots have acquired the inter-tower networking function and are irreplaceable regardless.

**Failure modes:**

- **Deferred maintenance death.** A tower that loses Healers (disease, war, population crash) keeps standing — existing lattice is strong. But underground, cracks go unsealed. Established flow channels develop within years. Voids within decades. Catastrophic sinkhole within centuries. Irreversible well before collapse — once channels establish, no Healer effort reclaims them. The tower is already dead; it hasn't fallen yet.
- **Sinkhole pools.** A collapse that fills with ammonia creates a tower-adjacent pool — an additional mechanism for pool formation alongside wind-scour basins (§10.1).
- **Even mature towers are not 100% immune.** Some sinkholes develop in locations the root network monitors poorly, or progress faster than the sealing response. Partial sinkholes at tower periphery are a background geological hazard — not catastrophic, but a persistent maintenance load.

## 11. Pore Architecture, Surface Features, and Habitat Scale

### 11.1 Pore sizes

For a 3D lattice of ~2 mm struts (from Aeolian tone: St ≈ 0.2, v ≈ 10 m/s, f ≈ 1 kHz), strut pitch scales with solids fraction as p ≈ d × √(3π/4φ):

| Location | Solids fraction | Strut pitch | Pore opening |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apex (youngest, lightest) | ~5% | ~14 mm | ~12 mm |
| Mid-height | ~8% | ~11 mm | ~9 mm |
| Base (densest, Healer-renovated) | ~15% | ~8 mm | ~6 mm |

These are large relative to most atmospheric particulate but small relative to any macroscopic organism.

### 11.2 Lattice opacity

Throughflow velocity decays exponentially with depth. For 2 mm struts at pitch p with loss coefficient K ≈ 0.2 per layer: U(x) = U₀ × exp(−Kx/2p). Decay length L = 2p/K:

| Zone | Pitch | Solids | Velocity decay length (1/e) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apex | 14 mm | 5% | ~14 cm |
| Mid-height | 11 mm | 8% | ~10 cm |
| Base | 8 mm | 15% | ~5 cm |

At 50 cm depth (apex), throughflow is essentially zero. The tower is **~80–85% opaque** to bulk throughflow across its full chord. Air enters the windward face, decelerates within the first ~15–30 cm, turns, and flows upward through the lattice interior at low velocity (~0.5–1 m/s), exiting at the summit. This slow interior flow assists H₂ waste removal (chimney draft) and moderate SiH₄ replenishment in metabolically active zones.

### 11.3 Collection: two growth modes

The tower's collection requirements depend fundamentally on its growth mode. These are distinct regimes with different feedstock, and the lattice geometry serves both but is optimized for neither — it is shaped by structural and symbiote-habitat constraints.

**Mode 1: Catalytic surface growth (proto-tower, pre-symbiote)**

The original autocatalytic N:SiC surface ceramifies deposited material. Feedstock is whatever lands on the active surface — primarily **lightning-forged molecular species**: PCS oligomers, silazane fragments, nascent molecular clusters (nm to μm scale) produced by atmospheric lightning chemistry from SiH₄ + NH₃ + CH₄. These pre-formed building blocks are essential to catalytic growth; the surface incorporates them, it doesn't synthesize from raw gas.

| Regime | Target | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Diffusion capture | 1–10 nm clusters | Brownian diffusion to catalytic surface | D ≈ 10⁻⁹ m²/s at 8 bar. Slow. Surface area matters. |
| Electrostatic capture | 10–100 nm aerosol | Charged-particle attraction to conductive surface | MPPS range. Lightning-charged lattice provides the field. |
| Inertial impaction | > ~1 μm particles | Stokes-number impaction | St > 0.1 for d > 1.3 μm on 2 mm struts at 9.5 m/s. |
| Direct gas reaction | SiH₄ | Catalytic decomposition on active surface | SiH₄ → SiC/SiCN directly. Significant but slower than molecular deposition. |

In this mode, the lattice opacity is directly beneficial: slow interior flow maximizes residence time for nm-scale diffusion capture, and the large internal surface area provides collection surface. The windward face geometry matters for impaction of larger fragments. **All four capture regimes contribute.**

**Mode 2: Symbiote CVD construction (mature tower)**

Healers perform arc-CVD from **raw atmospheric gases**: SiH₄ + NH₃ + CH₄ → SiCN + H₂, using grid-supplied electrical power. They synthesize lattice material from scratch. Pre-formed molecular building blocks from lightning chemistry are **not required** — the Healers do their own chemistry.

| Input | Source | Delivery |
|---|---|---|
| SiH₄ (0.3% atm) | Atmosphere | Gas diffusion to all surfaces. D ≈ 2×10⁻⁶ m²/s at 8 bar; crosses 6 mm gap in ~18 s. Trivially available everywhere in the lattice. Metabolic rate is the limit, not transport. |
| N₂ (55%), NH₃ (12.5%), CH₄ (10%) | Atmosphere | Gas diffusion. Superabundant. Not rate-limiting. |
| Catalytic metals (Ti, Fe, etc.) | Miners (primary), volcanic dust (secondary) | Miner chelation delivery is the primary path. Windward-face impaction of metal-bearing volcanic dust is supplementary. |
| Electrical energy | Lightning grid | Schottky coupling to lattice. |

In this mode, the tower is not a filter in any meaningful sense — it is a **gas-phase chemical reactor** bathed in its own feedstock. The lattice opacity is irrelevant to nutrition; it is a passive consequence of the structural geometry. Interior airflow assists waste removal (H₂ exhaust via chimney draft) and SiH₄ replenishment, but these are secondary effects, not the reason the lattice exists.

**Windward surface features (both modes, but context differs):**

1. **Dendrite tips.** Short (~0.1–0.5 mm) SiCN projections extending from the strut's windward face. In catalytic mode: increase collection area for atmospheric molecular deposition. In mature mode: increase surface area for metal-bearing dust capture (volcanic particulate from katabatic wind). Healer-deposited, biologically cheap.
2. **Electrostatic enhancement.** Lightning-charged conductive lattice attracts triboelectrically charged wind-borne particles. In catalytic mode: captures nm-scale molecular clusters (essential). In mature mode: captures metal-bearing dust (supplementary to Miner delivery).
3. **In situ metabolic processing.** Windward-face symbiotes (primarily Healers) chelate and metabolize captured particles within hours. The windward face is simultaneously a collection surface and a processing surface. **In mature towers, the primary value of windward capture is metal recovery, not structural material.**

### 11.4 Leeward solar collection

**Photovoltaic material:** Elemental Si, not SiC. SiC bandgap (2.3–3.3 eV) is too wide for the star's peak emission at ~850 nm. Si bandgap (1.12 eV) absorbs all photons below ~1100 nm. In the reducing atmosphere (no O₂), elemental Si is stable — no oxidation. Healer synthesis: SiH₄ → Si + 2H₂ (the *simpler* reaction, omitting the carbon source used for SiC).

**Geometry:** At the terminator, the star is at the horizon. Sunlight arrives horizontally from the substellar direction. The leeward face (roughly day-facing) is the primary illuminated surface. At ~15° Coriolis deflection (mid-latitude), the leeward face normal is 15° off from the sun direction — cos(15°) ≈ 0.97, negligible loss.

**Optimization incentive: weak.** Terminator towers have massive lightning surplus. Solar contributes real but marginal power. The tower is poorly incentivized to optimize solar collection geometry. Si films exist on leeward surfaces as a low-effort ambient harvest (the simpler CVD reaction deposited on whatever surfaces face the sun), not as precision-engineered photovoltaic arrays. No asymmetric flank treatment, no latitude-dependent Healer programs. The incentive increases day-ward (deposition zone towers get less lightning, more sun).

### 11.5 Habitat scale hierarchy

The 6–12 mm native pore openings establish that **tower structure is not megafauna housing.** The lattice is scaled for wind physics and symbiote biology. Amorph habitation requires excavation at a completely different scale.

| Scale | Occupant | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Native lattice (6–12 mm pores) | Middle-kingdom organisms (insect-scale), individual symbiotes (Healers, Miners, Guards) | Native — organisms navigate the lattice directly. The 5-zone strut ecology operates here. |
| Excavated chambers (meter-scale) | Amorphs (megafauna) | Healer-built. Material removed from lattice, surrounding structure densified to redistribute load. Every amorph-accessible space is artificial. |
| Chimney conduits (multi-meter) | Gas transport (H₂ exhaust, buoyancy draft) | Primary function is gas flow. May double as amorph transit corridors. Not purpose-built for habitation. |

The tower was not built to house amorphs. Amorphs moved in; Healers excavated space for them — because the network has incentive to keep mutualists close (metal delivery, external maintenance, defense). Housing is a service the tower provides in exchange for the mutualist relationship, not the tower's architectural purpose.

**Chamber size limit:** At 5% solids, the lattice is near minimum structural density. Excavating a chamber requires densifying the surrounding lattice to carry the redistributed load. Larger chamber = thicker reinforced walls = more biological investment. Upper bound on chamber size set by structural analysis (unresolved — see §13.2).

### 11.6 Exterior climbing by megafauna amorphs

**Can a megafauna amorph use the pore lattice to climb the tower exterior?** Yes.

**Mechanism:** The amorph extends gel tendrils into 6–12 mm pore openings, then stiffens them by redistributing SiC stock — a biological expansion bolt. Mechanical interlock, not friction. Load transfers to struts in shear.

**Load capacity:** A 2 mm SiC strut at ~9 MPa supports ~28 N per interlock point. A 100 kg amorph at 1.82g weighs ~1785 N — 64 struts under load, trivial when the contact surface covers thousands of pores. The lattice can support many times the amorph's weight.

**Practical constraints:**

| Factor | Windward face | Leeward face |
|---|---|---|
| Wind | 9.5 m/s, ~370 N drag on 1 m² profile (~20% body weight) | Sheltered, near-zero airflow |
| Climb speed | ~0.1 m/s (extend/grip/haul cycle) | ~0.1 m/s |
| Summit time (1 km) | ~3 hours | ~3 hours |
| Energy cost | High (fighting wind + gravity at 1.82g) | High (gravity only) |
| Healer response | Exposed to exterior Healer patrol | Exposed to exterior Healer patrol |

**Healer response depends on chelation badge:**
- Recognized mutualist (correct badge): tolerated, possibly assisted (debris cleared from climbing path).
- Unrecognized (wrong badge or none): active resistance — Healers seal pores ahead of climber, deposit material to block tendrils, signal network.

**The exterior climb is the unauthorized access route.** Normal amorph entry is through Healer-maintained corridors at the leeward base. Climbing the lattice exterior is physically possible but slow, exposed, energy-expensive, and contested by the tower's immune system if the climber lacks credentials. Narrative uses: infiltration during grid warfare, first contact by a wild amorph, emergency escape from a hostile tower interior.

**Recreational climbing and glide descent.** Amorphs do not fear falling — they can reshape to reduce terminal velocity below injury threshold. At 8 bar air density (~8 kg/m³), terminal velocity scales with spread area: ~10 m/s at 4 m², ~7 m/s at 8 m², ~5 m/s at 16 m². No fixed body plan means cross-section is a choice — the amorph dials in its descent rate. Even 10 m/s (lethal for a rigid-skeleton organism) is survivable for a gel body with no organs to rupture and selectively redistributed SiC crumple zones. A comfortable recreational descent would use maximum spread. (Same physics as balloon fauna fall-survival origin — see Skywhale Hub.)

**Descent tradeoff:** More spread = slower fall = more time aloft = more wind displacement. At 5 m/s descent from 1 km altitude in 9.5 m/s katabatic wind, horizontal displacement is ~1.9 km day-ward. Two descent modes:

1. **Vertical (recreational):** Jump from leeward face into the tower's wind shadow. Near-zero airflow in the lee. Spread wide, land gently at the tower base. Safe, controlled, predictable.
2. **Transit (tower-hopping):** Jump into the open wind toward the **next downwind tower**. Spread into crude airfoil (gel membrane, SiC-ribbed). At 8 bar air density, minimum glide speed ~7.5 m/s (100 kg amorph, 8 m² wing, CL ≈ 1.0). Glide ratio L/D ≈ 4–8 depending on aspect ratio and shaping effort (limited by gel flutter at high AR; practical best ~6). The target is not maximum range — it's the next tower. Landing between towers is useless (hours of ground travel to reach one).

   **Tower upwash.** The tower is ~80–85% opaque to bulk throughflow (see §11.2 — velocity decays within ~15–30 cm of the windward surface; the full chord is effectively a wall). This creates strong upwash along the windward face: **~3–5 m/s** vertical component (30–50% of freestream). This does NOT conflict with the tower's collection function — in mature towers (§11.3, Mode 2), the primary feedstock is gas-phase SiH₄ (diffuses to all surfaces regardless of flow direction) and metals (Miner-delivered). The lattice opacity is a passive consequence of structural geometry, not a nutritional optimization. Upwash vanishes above the summit (flow transitions to horizontal).

   Amorph terminal velocity at maximum spread (16 m²): ~4.3 m/s. Upwash of 3–5 m/s makes ground-level riding **marginal** — net ascent of −1.3 to +0.7 m/s depending on local upwash strength. At the base center of the windward face (strongest 2D constraint), upwash may reach 5–7 m/s, making passive riding possible but slow. Higher on the face, the upwash weakens as air routes to the sides, and riding becomes unreliable. **Practical model: the amorph climbs the lower face (upwash reduces effective weight by ~35–70%) and transitions to passive riding where the upwash is sufficient.** The crossover height is geometry-dependent and unresolved.

   **Tower-hop sequence (terminator, ~6.5 km spacing):**
   1. Launch from tower A summit (~1 km). Glide downwind at L/D ≈ 6–7.
   2. Approach tower B. Upwash zone extends ~200–500 m ahead of the windward face, providing significant lift that extends the glide. Simple geometry: L/D = 6 from 1 km loses ~1080 m over 6.5 km (marginal without assist); upwash on approach recovers ~200–400 m, making the hop reliable.
   3. Arrive at tower B's windward face at low altitude. Climb with upwash assist (reduced effective weight) through the lower face; transition to passive updraft riding where upwash exceeds sink rate.
   4. Reach summit altitude. Repeat from step 1.

   Each hop: **~10 min glide + climb/ride time (unresolved — depends on crossover height).** One-way only — upwind ground speed goes negative. Return by balloon via upper-level return flow (see Fauna Hub, "surfing" transit).

   **Spacing dependency:** Tower-hopping works at terminator spacing (~6.5 km) where the strong upwash makes the glide geometry close. At wider dark-side spacings (8–20 km), the glide path falls below ground level well before the next tower — hopping becomes impossible. Tower-hopping is a **terminator transit mode**, reinforcing the terminator as the high-connectivity zone.

Tower climbing is a zero-mortality-risk activity: the ascent is physical challenge (hours, 1.82g, pore-grip technique, windward face preferred for upwash weight reduction), the summit is a novel sensory environment (exposed EM, acoustic transition, raw wind), and the descent is either a controlled drop (leeward shadow) or tower-hopping transit (day-ward only). The recreational version would be a universal meme — easy to learn, hard to master, socially visible.

The pore lattice thus serves four simultaneous functions from one geometry: filtration machine, symbiote habitat, climbing surface, and security perimeter.

## 13. Open Questions

1. **~~Aerogel solids fraction~~** ✓ RESOLVED. Canonized: 3–5% (apex), 5–8% (mid), 8–12% (lower), 12–15% (base). Gibson-Ashby analysis gives safety factors 8–16 throughout — structural capacity is massively over-designed for self-weight compression. The profile is set by biological optimization (weight minimization at top, conductivity/habitat/construction cost at base), not structural necessity.
2. **~~Interior architecture detail~~** ✓ RESOLVED. Tower interior is uniformly symbiote-scale habitat (6–12 mm pore network) plus chimney conduits (multi-meter, gas transport). No megafauna-scale excavated chambers exist — see Q9. Amorphs live externally in root-buttress interstices and amorph-built structures. The §11.5 "excavated chambers" model is superseded; retained as theoretical structural analysis only.
3. **~~Fibonacci spacing numbers~~** ✓ RESOLVED (§10.2). ~6.5 km at terminator, widening to ~20 km deep dark. Root attenuation (~10–20 km unboosted) is binding constraint. Cross-wind blockage ~3%.
4. **~~Healer construction program specifics~~** ✓ RESOLVED. **Programmable symbiote model.** Symbiote genomes encode a repertoire of deterministic signal-response primitives (deposit, stop, move, increase density, switch composition, etc.), NOT architectural blueprints. Complex construction emerges from complex signal sequences orchestrated by the tower's lattice — the tower is the programmer, symbiotes are programmable logic gates. The blueprint lives in the signal patterns (lattice topology + network management). Convergent architecture = firmware standardization. Network wars = firmware wars (reprogram absorbed towers via new signal patterns, no need to replace symbiotes). Crisis degradation = program degradation (fewer units → simpler executable programs). Amorphs can direct Healers by learning and replaying the tower's signal protocol — protocol acquisition is a meme, not a breeding program (see Industrialization Hub §3).
5. **~~Catalytic reaction status in modern towers~~** ✓ RESOLVED. Definitively dead in all fully-renewed towers. Healer SiCN lacks metallosilazane catalytic sites (metals not in atmospheric CVD feedstock; metal incorporation anti-selected). Ship of Theseus has replaced all original material. "Reaction front only" in the aliveness spectrum is an early-life state (Phase 1), not achievable by degradation of a modern tower. Crisis pathway for modern towers: full reef → degraded → inert (skips reaction-front-only). Dependence on symbiotes is absolute and irreversible.
6. **~~Base-to-root transition~~** ✓ RESOLVED — substrate-dependent, no universal template. The transition geometry is determined by local monadnock geology (fracture density, mineralogy, bedding), which varies across the base of a single tower. Densely fractured zones: deep root interpenetration, lattice and rock merge with no clear boundary, small/numerous interstices, best anchorage and sinkhole defense. Sparsely fractured zones: shallow roots along few fracture traces, lattice sits more distinctly on rock, large interstices between widely-spaced buttresses (better amorph habitat, worse anchorage). Bedded/layered rock: horizontal root sheets along bedding contacts, flat sheltered interstice geometry. A single tower base can exhibit all three modes on different flanks. Every tower footprint is unique. Interstice geometry (and therefore amorph habitat quality) varies around the circumference — prime real estate is flank-specific.
7. **~~Pre-Healer root mechanism~~** ✓ RESOLVED. Same Phase 1 autocatalytic surface reaction that builds the tower, growing laterally along exposed deep-rock fracture traces at the monadnock surface. Amplified by resistance crossover: as lightning-driven downward ceramification stalls in the PCS gap (power ∝ 1/R²_total), current shifts to lateral surface paths (Kirchhoff). Pre-biotic proto-root network — dendritic, fracture-following. Healers inherit and optimize, replacing slow catalytic growth with fast directed arc-CVD. See §2.2 Phase 1.
8. **~~Visual/sensory experience of tower interior~~** ✓ RESOLVED. The amorph sensory palette is EM (primary), acoustic, chemical, mechanical — not primarily visual. **EM:** The lattice carries grid current and network signals continuously. Inside the tower is a dense, structured EM field — not noise but patterned signal (symbiote coordination, energy-gradient management, network data). Windward shell is loudest (steepest gradients, densest symbiote activity). Interior structural webbing creates partial Faraday shielding — deeper = quieter. Base: heavy current, dense traffic. Apex: lighter, simpler, more atmospheric EM leaking in. **Acoustic:** Layered, not tonal. Windward shell generates broadband biological noise (wind through irregularly-coated pores), NOT clean Aeolian tones (symbiote coating damps vortex shedding). Clean ~1 kHz tones come from bare interior struts behind the living shell. Low-frequency structural vibration from wind loading. Chimney draft hiss. Dead towers sound completely different — pure Aeolian tones everywhere, no biological noise (see §9.1). **Chemical:** SiH₄ decreases windward-to-leeward (filter strips it). H₂ increases (metabolic waste). Chimney channels: H₂-rich, warm. Readable gradients for orientation. **Height progression:** Base (EM-dense, acoustically sheltered, warm from geothermal roots — feels like inside a machine). Mid (quieter EM, wind-sound dominant, chimney draft, tower's tonal voice clearest). Upper (EM thins, wind increases, atmospheric EM leaks in). Apex (exposed — full wind, full thunder, full atmospheric EM, sensory overload for a ground-dweller).
9. **~~Maximum excavated chamber size~~** ✓ RESOLVED — PREMISE REJECTED. Amorphs do not excavate chambers inside the biological tower. Two independent barriers: (a) the tower's immune system (Healers/Guards) actively resists unauthorized structural damage — chelation badge = tolerated surface mutualist, not licensed demolition contractor; (b) the tower-reverence meme (one of the oldest universal amorph memes, budding-transmitted, predating tool use) makes deliberate tower damage psychological sacrilege. Structural analysis (Kirsch solution for void stress, vault buckling) shows 30 m spans are *theoretically feasible* with densified shells at mid-tower solids fractions, but this capability is never exercised. Amorphs live in root-buttress interstices (external, naturally occurring) and in amorph-built structures (see Industrialization Hub). Tower interior remains symbiote-scale habitat (6–12 mm pore network) throughout.
10. **~~Upwash crossover height~~** ✓ RESOLVED. **~750–850 m on a 1 km terminator tower (~75–85% of height).** The critical constraint is 3D flow routing: the tower is much taller than wide (aspect ratio ~7 at base), so blocked wind preferentially routes around the flanks rather than over the top. Upwash is weak below ~500 m (1–2 m/s, lateral routing dominates), builds through 500–750 m (2–4 m/s), crosses the 4.3 m/s amorph sink rate at ~750–850 m, and reaches 5–8 m/s in the apex zone (850–1000 m) where flow is forced over the narrowing crest. Climb/ride split: ~80% physical climbing (hours, pore-grip technique), ~20% passive upwash riding to summit. Center of windward face has strongest upwash (most 2D-constrained); near flanks, lateral routing dominates at all heights — experienced climbers favor the center line. Continuous terminator rain is not a significant factor: amorph glide surfaces are biological membranes (not precision airfoils), pore-grip is mechanical interlock (wet-insensitive), rain-drag opposes upwash by only ~0.5 m/s. Upstream approach zone (200–500 m ahead of face): weak upwash (1–3 m/s), extends tower-hop glide geometry but doesn't support soaring.
