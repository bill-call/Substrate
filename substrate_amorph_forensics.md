# SUBSTRATE — AMORPH FORENSICS

**v1.0 — February 2026**

The chemistry of death, information persistence, and post-mortem recovery. A Monk discipline.

---

## 1. THE INFORMATION PERSISTENCE PROBLEM

Amorph identity is their molecular library — polysilane chains encoding memories, experiences, skills, and selfhood. When an amorph dies, what happens to that information?

**What makes the library readable:**

1. Polysilane backbone intact (Si-Si chain)
2. Side chains still attached (H, CH₃, NH₂, SiH₃)
3. Something capable of electronic readout

If any of these fail, information is lost — partially or completely.

---

## 2. DEATH MECHANISMS AND INFORMATION SURVIVAL

| Mechanism | Chemical process | Backbone | Side chains | Information status |
|-----------|------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Fluorine poisoning** | Si + F₂ → SiF₄ (gas) | Destroyed | Destroyed | **TOTAL LOSS** |
| **Petrification (H₂O/O₂)** | Si-NH-Si → Si-O-Si → SiO₂ | Converted to glass | Degrade over time | **FOSSIL** |
| **Starvation** | Chemistry stops, structure intact | Intact | Intact | **BEST CASE** |
| **Frozen (night side)** | Metabolism stops, preserved | Intact | Intact | **PRESERVED** |
| **Decomposer action** | Active breakdown | Being digested | Being stripped | **TIME-LIMITED** |
| **Crystallization disease** | Cross-linking | Distorted | May survive | **PARTIAL** |
| **Physical destruction** | Crushed, torn | Fragments | On fragments | **FRAGMENTARY** |
| **Predation** | Consumed | Incorporated | Incorporated | **TRANSFERRED** |

## 3. THE GRADIENT OF INFORMATION DEATH

```
FULLY READABLE          PARTIALLY READABLE          UNREADABLE
      |                        |                        |
  starvation              decomposition             fluorine
   frozen                crystallization           petrification
      |                   fragmentation            (late stage)
      |                        |                        |
  structure               structure                 structure
  intact                  degrading                   gone
```

**Key insight:** There is no binary alive/dead for information. There is a gradient of degradation, with different mechanisms producing different outcomes.

## 4. DECOMPOSITION TIMELINE

Decomposition is the default death. When an amorph's EM heartbeat signal stops, decomposers recognize "food" and move in.

| Phase | Approximate time | Library status |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| Just dead | Minutes | Fully intact |
| Decomposers arriving | Hours | Surface degradation begins |
| Active decomposition | Days | Outer layers consumed, core still readable |
| Advanced decomposition | Weeks | Fragmentary at best |
| Complete breakdown | Months | Raw materials only |

**Timescales depend on:**
- Decomposer density (higher at terminator)
- Temperature (faster when warm)
- Body size (larger takes longer)
- Location (pools vs. dry surface vs. frozen night)

---

## 5. FORENSIC RECOVERY WINDOWS

| Scenario | Window | Recovery potential |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Recent death, terminator | Hours | Near-complete |
| Recent death, day side | Hours to days | Near-complete (fewer decomposers) |
| Frozen corpse, night side | Years to millennia | Excellent if preserved |
| Active decomposition | Days | Partial — core fragments |
| Old decomposition | Weeks+ | Fragmentary — luck dependent |
| Petrified | N/A | Structure visible, unreadable biologically |
| Fluorinated | N/A | Nothing to recover |

---

## 6. THE MONK FORENSICS DISCIPLINE

The Monks possess unique capabilities for forensic recovery:

**Core skills:**
- Direct meme reading (developed through tower communion)
- Ability to interface with degraded/partial libraries
- Archive comparison (detect corruption, fill gaps)
- Patience (can work slowly, carefully on damaged material)

**Services:**

| Service | Description | Ethical status |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Last rites** | Extract library from dying individual, with consent | Accepted |
| **Recovery** | Read recently dead, preserve what's recoverable | Presumed consent? Family request? |
| **Investigation** | Read dead to determine cause of death, last experiences | Who authorizes? Who sees? |
| **Cold archaeology** | Read ancient frozen dead from night side | Consent impossible |
| **Testimony** | Provide recovered memories as evidence | Verifiability problem |

---

## 7. ETHICAL COMPLEXITIES

### 7.1 Consent

| Situation | Consent status | Problem |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Living, awake | Can give/refuse | Clear |
| Dying, conscious | Can give/refuse | Time pressure |
| Just dead | Presumed from prior wishes? | May not have expressed wishes |
| Long dead | Impossible | Who speaks for them? |
| Ancient dead | Impossible | Is it archaeology or violation? |

### 7.2 Privacy of the Dead

Reading someone's library exposes:
- Their memories (including private ones)
- Their relationships
- Their secrets
- Their traumas
- Their crimes (if any)

**Does death end privacy?** The Monks likely have factions:

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Preservationist** | All knowledge should be saved; the dead don't need privacy |
| **Respectist** | The dead deserve dignity; only read with prior consent or necessity |
| **Pragmatist** | Depends on circumstances; balance knowledge vs. privacy case by case |

### 7.3 The Verification Problem

A Monk reports: "I recovered this from the deceased. Here's what they knew."

**How would anyone verify this?**

The Monks can:
- Read memes directly
- Edit memes
- Manufacture memes

If a Monk says "the dead amorph's last memory was X," there is no way to independently confirm this. The Monk could be:
- Accurate
- Mistaken (read corrupted data)
- Lying (invented or edited the "recovery")

**Forensic testimony requires trust in the Monk.** This makes Monk integrity existentially important — and Monk corruption existentially dangerous.

## 8. SPECIAL CASES

### 8.1 Fluorine Death

**Information status: Total loss.**

Fluorine attacks silicon directly:
```
Si + 2F₂ → SiF₄ (gas, escapes)
```

The substrate itself is destroyed. There is nothing left to read — no fragments, no fossils, just absence.

**Implications:**
- Fluorine weapons are information-death weapons
- Murder by fluorine leaves no forensic evidence (from the victim)
- Suicide by fluorine is permanent in a way other deaths are not

### 8.2 Petrification

**Information status: Fossil.**

Water/oxygen converts the silazane matrix:
```
Si-NH-Si → Si-O-Si → SiO₂
```

The structure is preserved as glass/silite, but electronic readout no longer works. The polysilane backbone is chemically converted.

**Could future technology read it?** Possibly. The physical structure of the chains might be preserved in mineral form. Extremely advanced imaging might reconstruct the original sequences from the fossil geometry. But this is speculative — no current biological reader can access it.

### 8.3 Frozen Night-Side Corpses

**Information status: Preserved.**

Cold dramatically slows:
- Decomposer metabolism
- Chemical degradation
- Diffusion of reactive species

A corpse frozen quickly on the night side might remain readable for millennia.

**The ancient dead:** The night side may harbor frozen corpses from deep history — individuals who died before the Monks existed, whose libraries contain memories of events no living amorph recalls.

**The ethical problem:** These individuals never consented to being read. They may contain knowledge that challenges current understanding, implicates living lineages, or contradicts official history. Reading them is archaeology, history, and potential betrayal simultaneously.

### 8.4 Predation and Incorporation

**Information status: Transferred.**

When an amorph is eaten, some library fragments may survive digestion and incorporate into the predator's library.

**This could be:**
- Accidental (fragments persist as "noise")
- Deliberate (consuming someone to gain their knowledge)
- Ritualized (funerary cannibalism to preserve the dead)

**Question:** If you eat someone and gain fragments of their memory, are those memories *yours* or *theirs*? Does their identity partially survive in you?

## 9. MURDER AND EVIDENCE

The forensics discipline intersects with justice:

| Murder method | Evidence from victim | Other evidence |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Fluorine | None | Environmental residue, witness |
| Physical destruction | Last moments readable from fragments | Physical evidence |
| Poisoning/starvation | Complete record up to death | |
| Decomposer acceleration | Time-limited; may recover partial | |
| Staged accident | Full record reveals truth | |

**Fluorine is the perfect murder weapon** — it destroys the victim's testimony along with their body. The only evidence comes from external sources.

This may explain why fluorine weapons are so feared beyond their direct lethality. They don't just kill. They erase.

---

## 10. FORENSICS AND THE MEME-LIAR PLAGUE

**The compounding problem:**

If the dead amorph's library was corrupted by meme-liar fragments before death, the forensic recovery will contain those corruptions. The Monk reads "true" data that was already false.

**Worse:** If the Monk performing the forensics is themselves corrupted, they may:
- Misread accurate data
- "Correct" data that was actually true
- Introduce new corruptions during the recovery process

**The Monks' unique position:**

The Monks are both:
- The only ones who can verify information against archive
- The only ones who could falsify information at the source

They are the immune system and the potential plague vector simultaneously.
