bonds (compatible with silicon life). Water vapor is a trace oxidizer
that causes chronic petrification.

3\. GEOLOGY AND TECTONICS

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

3.1 Tectonic Regime

**✓ RESOLVED:** Stagnant lid. Single thick lithospheric shell. No plate
tectonics, no subduction. Mantle heat escapes through volcanic plumes
that punch through the lid from below.

Higher mass (4.2 M⊕) means higher internal pressures. Mantle minerals
(bridgmanite, post-perovskite) are significantly more viscous. The
lithosphere is thicker and stronger than Earth's. Classical plate
tectonics cannot initiate. Consistent with current geophysical modeling
for super-Earths in this mass range (Noack, Stamenkovć, Valencia).

Radiogenic inventory: \~4.2x Earth's total U/Th/K-40. Large heat budget,
but higher-viscosity mantle impedes efficient heat transport. Heat
escapes through plumes rather than plates.

3.2 Hemispheric Asymmetry

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tidal lock creates permanent thermal gradient through
the lithosphere. Day-side lid is warmer, thinner, weaker. Dark-side lid
is colder, thicker, stronger. Mantle plumes preferentially breach the
day side.

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Day side: Volcanically active. Continuous plume volcanism, not episodic
overturn — hemispheric asymmetry is a permanent pressure-release valve
(thin day-side lid prevents heat accumulation that would trigger global
foundering). 10–30 volcanic provinces active simultaneously. ~80–100
km³/yr magma production (~4× Earth). ~100 Myr full resurfacing interval.
Plume-driven shield volcanoes, flood basalt provinces, volcanic plateaux.
Fresh mineral surfaces. Source of atmospheric SiH₄ + H₂O outgassing.

Dark side: Geologically quiescent. Ancient, stable crust. Minimal
volcanism. Lid too thick and cold for plumes to penetrate. This
stability is why the anti-stellar pole towers have accreted undisturbed
for billions of years.

Terminator: Lithospheric flexure zone. Transition from thin active
day-side lithosphere to thick stable dark-side lithosphere. Chronic
cracking, faulting, mild seismicity. Not subduction but persistent
stress concentration where the two thermal regimes meet.

3.3 Fracture Networks

Fracture networks are discontinuous and heterogeneous. They cluster
around: the terminator flexure zone (primary), day-side volcanic plume
provinces, and cooling-contraction cracks in old lava flows. Each
cluster is an island of fractured, permeable rock separated from the
next by unfractured, impermeable lithosphere.

**✓ RESOLVED:** The discontinuity of fracture networks is what creates
multiple independent deep-rock systems. Geology creates the isolation.
Towers break it.

3.4 Ammonia Sea Basins

**[REVISED V2.4]** Ammonia seas are **tower-dependent features** in the modern era. Any topographic depression on the dark side is a sediment trap: atmospheric particulate falls out where katabatic wind meets liquid surface (wave-induced turbulence trips boundary layer, drops carrying capacity), all particulate sinks in ammonia (SiC: 3200 kg/m³, silicate: 2500+ kg/m³, ammonia: 660 kg/m³), and without outflow the basin fills. Over geological time, every unprotected depression fills with sediment and ceases to exist.

Towers are the only self-repairing roughness element on the planet. A tower breaks the otherwise aerodynamically smooth boundary layer (Re ~10¹² precludes true laminar, but surface roughness < viscous sublayer ~50 μm), creating turbulence → scour basins and complex depositional topography → depressions that hold ammonia. The tower's ongoing turbulence actively maintains the basin against sediment infilling. Kill the tower, the turbulence stops, and the peneplain reclaims the basin within geological time.

**Shore deposition zones:** Where katabatic wind meets ammonia surface, waves create roughness elements, the boundary layer trips to turbulent, and the wind's particulate carrying capacity drops. Atmospheric fallout accumulates at the shoreline — SiC grit, volcanic fines, dead-bug plume debris (catalytic metals, library fragments, SiC plates). The shore is the primary nutrient delivery system connecting the atmospheric conveyor to the marine ecosystem, and the main reason shore/intertidal is the richest marine zone.

Terminator basins remain the primary sea locations (tower arrays densest, rain supply direct, fracture-zone topography supplements tower turbulence). Dark-side seas exist only where tower arrays extend dark-ward of the terminator. Locations are permanent on civilizational timescales but shift over geological time as tower arrays migrate or die.

3.5 Dark-Side Surface Geomorphology

**[NEW IN V2.4]** The dark side is a **mirror-smooth SiC-polished bedrock peneplain**. Three factors combine:

1. **No constructive geology.** No volcanism (lid too thick), no tectonics (stagnant lid), no uplift. Nothing rebuilds terrain.
2. **Continuous SiC abrasion.** Pre-biotic volcanic SiC (~9 Tg/yr from mantle moissanite + surface pyrolysis, ~0.08% of conveyor particulate) begins smoothing silicate bedrock at ~600 mm/Myr even before biology exists. The dead-bug plume later adds massive biological SiC, dramatically accelerating erosion to produce the mirror-polish. SiC (Mohs 9.5) abrading silicate bedrock (Mohs 6-7) over billions of years polishes the surface to sub-grain-scale smoothness. The smooth→polished transition is a geological marker of the biosphere's onset.
3. **No accumulation.** The atmospheric particulate conveyor is a closed loop (see §3.6). Material passes through the dark side without accumulating.

The surface roughness falls below the viscous sublayer (~50 μm), producing an **aerodynamically smooth turbulent boundary layer** — Re ~10¹² precludes true laminar flow, but the surface is too smooth to generate roughness-driven turbulence. The narrative consequence is identical: only towers (self-repairing SiC lattice) disturb the flow. All topographic complexity on the dark side is tower-generated.

**Visual:** From orbit, the dark side is a polished plain extending to the horizon, punctuated by tower arrays with ammonia seas at their feet. The contrast with the day side (active volcanic terrain — shield volcanoes, flood basalt provinces, yardangs and ventifacts sculpted by wind) is extreme.

**Day-side geomorphology:** Volcanic construction dominates near substellar. Wind erosion increases with distance from substellar. Gradient from construction-dominated (young, rugged volcanic terrain) to erosion-dominated (streamlined remnant topography) to pure peneplain (terminator). The deposition zone 20–40° day-ward of the terminator accumulates deep sediment (km) from wind-transported mineral and volcanic ash.

3.6 Atmospheric Particulate Conveyor

**[NEW IN V2.4]** The atmosphere functions as a closed-loop particulate transport system:

1. Day-side volcanism surfaces raw materials (ash, mineral particulate).
2. Surface winds carry particulate toward the substellar chimney.
3. Chimney lofts fine material into the superstream. The chimney acts as a **grain-size filter** — only material light enough to be vertically lofted enters the loop.
4. Superstream carries particulate toward the anti-stellar downdraft. Superstream velocity **increases** toward the anti-stellar point (spherical convergence: flow area ∝ sin(θ) → 0 as θ → 0). Anything carried past the terminator goes the full distance. No dropout en route.
5. Anti-stellar downdraft deposits material on the surface.
6. Katabatic surface winds re-entrain deposited material and carry it back toward the terminator and day side.

**The loop closes** because the chimney's grain-size filter ensures that everything entering the superstream is fine enough for the katabatic wind to re-entrain. Both halves of the Hadley cell carry the same mass flux (steady state), so their particulate carrying capacities are comparable.

**Anti-stellar dust cap:** Minor exception to the no-accumulation rule. Katabatic wind velocity starts at ~0 m/s at the anti-stellar stagnation point and the downdraft deposits material directly. The finest fraction may accumulate locally where wind is too gentle to re-entrain. Self-limiting and geologically insignificant — the stagnation zone is small and any accumulation reduces the local thermal gradient that drives the katabatic wind in the first place.

**No significant cyclonic activity at convergence points.** Both the substellar and anti-stellar points are on the equator (f = 0). Rotation rate is ~4% of Earth's (18-day period). Equatorial Rossby deformation radius (~20,000 km) exceeds the planetary radius (~8,600 km). The circulation is a broad, thermally-direct overturning with equatorial superrotation (Matsuno-Gill pattern), not discrete vortices. Coriolis modifies the flow (Ro ≈ 0.17–0.28 at mid-latitudes) but does not produce cyclones.

3.7 Volcanic Outgassing and the Atmospheric Budget

**✓ RESOLVED:** Day-side volcanism is the primary mechanism replenishing
atmospheric silane. The atmosphere is a reservoir: biological
consumption draws silane down, volcanic outgassing replaces it.

**[NEW IN V2.3]** **✓ RESOLVED: One-way silicon cycle.** SiH₄ → biological Si → SiC/SiO₂
surface deposits (permanent). No subduction means no recycling of
surface silicon back to the mantle. Only fresh mantle processing
regenerates SiH₄. The biosphere is consuming a finite inheritance.

**[NEW IN V2.3]** **✓ RESOLVED: SiH₄ formation is pressure-dominated.**
At depth, Si + 2H₂ → SiH₄. Δn_gas = -1, so high P(H₂) is the dominant
lever (P(SiH₄) ∝ P(H₂)²). Temperature also helps (endothermic, van 't
Hoff) but K is capped at ~10⁻⁴ by the entropy penalty. At ~100 km
depth with P(H₂) ≈ 8,000 bar and T ≈ 1500K, equilibrium SiH₄ partial
pressure is ~460 bar. Kinetically trapped during magma ascent.
Production tracks hottest mantle volume above ~1500K threshold — decline
is nonlinear because both K(T) and available volume shrink together.

**[NEW IN V2.3]** **✓ RESOLVED: H₂O ratchet.** Volcanic H₂O accumulates permanently in
the atmosphere and ammonia seas. Three locks prevent self-cleaning:
(1) v_esc 18.6 km/s retains H₂, so H₂O photolysis is reversible (H + OH
→ H₂O); (2) NH₃ UV-shields H₂O from photolysis in the first place;
(3) no thermal reaction between SiH₄ and H₂O at 240K surface
temperatures. Pre-crisis: surplus SiH₄ scavenges volcanic H₂O at source
(SiH₄ + 2H₂O → SiO₂ + 4H₂, volcanic SiH₄/H₂O ≈ 6:1 by mass vs
stoichiometric 0.89:1). Crisis: SiH₄ deficit → unscavenged H₂O enters
atmosphere and seas → chronic petrification stress on silicon life.

**[NEW IN V2.3]** The amorphs may have accelerated the crisis through
industrial-scale silane processing, but they did not cause it — the
one-way cycle made crisis inevitable from the moment life evolved.

3.8 Fissile Materials

Uranium and thorium present. \~4.2x Earth's total inventory.
Concentrated through magmatic differentiation in day-side volcanic
provinces (incompatible elements enrich in late-stage melts).
Additionally, ammonia hydrothermal systems in terminator fracture zones
may mobilize and concentrate uranium through uranyl-ammine complexes.
Deposits are magmatic and ammonia-deposited rather than sedimentary and
water-deposited.

Nuclear thermal propulsion (uranium-heated H₂, Isp \~900s) is physically
possible but culturally and technologically distant from silicon
biochemistry.

3.9 Metal Ore Deposits

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

Reducing atmosphere means native metals (iron, copper, nickel) are more
stable than on Earth. No oxidation. Volcanic processes concentrate
metals through magmatic differentiation and ammonia-thermal hydrothermal
circulation (metal-ammine complexes instead of aqueous metal complexes).
Day-side volcanic provinces have concentrated metal deposits around
vents: native metals, metal silicides, metal nitrides.

Most metal ores are already reduced. The metallurgical problem is heat,
not chemistry. No need for chemical reduction (smelting). See Section
11.8 (Metallurgy).

4\. DEEP-ROCK BIOSPHERE

**\[NEW IN V2 --- MAJOR REFRAME\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The deep-rock biosphere is the trunk. Towers are
branches. Amorphs are fruit. The subsurface network is not
infrastructure built by towers --- it is the organism the towers grew
out of.

4.1 The Original Life

**[REVISED V2.4+]** The deep-rock biosphere is not a collection of
organisms in the conventional sense. It is a network of chemically active
reaction fronts — metallosilazane catalytic chemistry self-perpetuating
through fracture networks, metabolizing geothermally mobilized SiH₄ and
depositing N-doped SiC as structural waste. The oldest continuous chemical
lineage on the planet. Simpler than surface life: purely chemolithotrophic,
no photovoltaics, no atmospheric silane dependency. The same fundamental
chemistry the tower symbiotes use, because the tower symbiotes are
descendants of the surface expression of this system. See §4.8 for
detailed characterization of the reaction front.

The conductive mineral traces thread through rock along paths of least
resistance: faults, grain boundaries, pore spaces. Over geological time,
each system's subsurface network becomes extensive. The network conducts
because the mineral conducts. Signals propagate because electricity
propagates through conductors. No intent required.

4.2 Multiple Independent Systems

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fracture networks are discontinuous. Each geologically
isolated fracture system hosts an independent deep-rock system. Systems
evolve independently for hundreds of millions of years. Different signal
protocols, different metabolic quirks, different mineral microstructure.

The number of independent systems depends on the number and
distribution of isolated fracture networks. The geology's heterogeneity
determines the entire history of the network wars.

**□ OPEN:** How many independent systems? Handful, dozens, hundreds?
Depends on fracture network count.

4.3 Reaching the Surface

When a system's reaction front reaches the atmosphere, surface-facing chemistry encounters
atmospheric silane --- vastly richer than geothermal hydrogen. The
surface-colonizing lineage metabolizes faster, deposits more mineral,
grows upward into the silane gradient and the star's photons. Towers
nucleate.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tower ecology evolves not once but multiple times ---
independently, once for every system that reaches the surface. This is
not a propagated adaptation but a practically inevitable outcome of the
chemistry and environment. Convergent evolution so strongly constrained
it is barely evolution at all.

Constraints that force convergence: identical atmosphere (composition,
pressure), identical star (spectrum matching silicon bandgap), identical
mineral chemistry, identical gas-diffusion limits (open lattice
geometry), identical photovoltaic opportunity (semiconductor surface
properties). Gross tower morphology is near-identical across all
systems. Signal protocols are completely incompatible.

4.4 The Deep-Rock / Surface Interface

Surface towers did not build roots downward to connect to each other.
They grew up from a connected substrate. Every tower is a surface
eruption of the subsurface system --- the way mushrooms are fruiting
bodies of a mycelium already continuous underground. The "root network"
is the system the towers grew out of.

Surface-level adaptations --- horizontal root connections between nearby
towers, optimized signal-relay pathways, power distribution --- are
later refinements of an existing underground anatomy, not new
construction.

4.5 Geological Pruning

Day-side volcanic eruptions periodically destroy portions of the
subsurface network. The deep-rock system loses sections and regrows into
new fracture networks as lava cools and cracks. The day-side subsurface
network is geologically young, repeatedly pruned. The dark-side
subsurface network is ancient, rarely interrupted — but the rare dark-side plume breakthrough (every ~500 Myr–1 Gyr) can sever connections within it, leading to fragmentation and protocol drift (see §10.7).

4.6 Crisis Survival

The deep-rock system does not depend on atmospheric silane. It runs on
geothermal chemistry. When the atmosphere fails and the surface
biosphere dies, the deep-rock system survives. The crisis kills the
branches but not the trunk. Without the probe, the planet's surface goes
sterile, and the deep-rock system continues alone in the dark, as it
did for eons before the surface was colonized.

The probe is not just saving amorph civilization. It is saving the
surface expression of a system that will outlive the crisis
regardless.

4.7 H₂O at Genesis Sites

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Silazane hydrolysis (K ≈ 1.6 × 10⁵ at 240K) makes
undefended silazane bonds thermodynamically unstable above ~6 ppm H₂O.
Pre-biotic chemistry has no repair machinery. Does trace H₂O kill
abiogenesis?

**Void genesis (deep-rock fractures): protected by reducing buffer.**
The metallic Si that generates SiH₄ also destroys H₂O (Si + 2H₂O →
SiO₂ + 2H₂). Fracture fluids are probably the most anhydrous
environment on the planet. No threat to pre-biotic silazane chemistry.

**Pool genesis (terminator ammonia pools): protected by distillation
shield.** At 240K, NH₃ vapor pressure >> H₂O (~10,000:1). Fresh
terminator pools fed by rain carry <1 ppm H₂O. At 0.1 ppm, only 1.6%
of silazane bonds hydrolyzed at equilibrium — negligible. Genesis is
viable. **[REVISED V2.4]** The proto-tower provides geomorphological
shelter (deep-rock system's surface SiC outcrop, Mohs 9.5, differential
erosion ratio ~100,000:1 vs silicate terrain) PLUS seven chemical/energetic
force multipliers for tower-adjacent pools: geothermal SiH₄ venting through
fractures (bypasses dissolution bottleneck), metal-enriched fluids (all four
biometals via hydrothermal circulation), lightning rod effect (concentrates
Miller-Urey products), warm fluids (+5–20K geothermal), N-doped SiC
semiconductor substrate (catalytic surfaces), flow-through hydrology
(maintains <1 ppm H₂O), and micro-pool multiplication (many parallel
experiments per monadnock). **⚠ However:** fracture-connected pools fill
too fast for genesis — geyser-cone construction fills pools in years to
decades; genesis requires My-scale. See §4.9 for the revised model.

**[REVISED V2.4+]** Pool genesis is **independent** of void genesis. Both
operate on the same planet, driven by mostly independent variables. Pool
genesis requires: stable terminator ammonia pool + atmospheric SiH₄ +
lightning + some metal source + My-scale time. Monadnock/tower proximity
helps (lightning rod, nutrient rain, metal delivery) but is not required.
Tower does not create life — tower byproducts create the selection regime
that drives pool life's evolution (see §4.9).

Genesis bar: self-replicating chemistry in supported environment,
not an autonomous organism. Void genesis (towers) is expected on any
suitable planet; pool genesis (mobile life) is a rare conjunction — Fermi
answer. See §3.7, Pool Genesis Hub §§2.5–2.7.

**The open sea (~50 ppm H₂O, ~89% hydrolysis) is hostile to undefended
silazane chemistry, but the sea is not a genesis site.** The pool-to-sea
transition is the evolutionary bottleneck where anti-petrification
defense must evolve. This explains why anti-petrification machinery is
universal and ancient in marine life: every marine lineage passed
through this filter. It also explains why pool-to-land at the terminator
is easier than pool-to-sea — land air has comparable H₂O to the birth
pool, while the sea has 50–100× more. See Pool Genesis Hub §2.4,
Chemistry Hub §10.3, Geology Hub §6.

4.8 Reaction Front Characterization

**[NEW IN V2.4+]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Deep-rock is **NOT an organism**. It is a chemically active
face — a reaction front of metallosilazane catalytic chemistry — with a
trail of dead (inert) N-doped SiC lattice behind it. No bounded body. No
reproduction. The front self-perpetuates as long as feedstock (SiH₄) and
energy (geothermal) are available. Multiple independent fronts share a
supply chain from a single vent.

**No active tail.** Behind the advancing front, pore throats narrow below
SiH₄ molecular diameter (~4.1 Å) but above H₂ (~2.9 Å). Dead fill is
H₂-permeable, SiH₄-opaque (molecular sieve). Isolated pores = functionally
solid. All catalytic activity confined to the advancing face. No distributed
reactor behind the front.

**Three rate regimes:** (1) Gas-transport colonization of new fractures:
~mm/s, geologically instantaneous. (2) Channel-fed active deposition:
~μm/s, declining as pores narrow. (3) Matrix-diffusion stasis: ~5 nm/yr
when all connected fractures filled (D_eff ≈ 2×10⁻¹⁰ m²/s through tight
rock).

**Exothermic thermal self-fracturing:** ΔH = −33 kJ/mol (SiH₄ + CH₄ →
SiC + 4H₂). Filling a 1mm fracture heats adjacent ~1cm rock shell by
~20K — at silicate thermal cracking threshold. The reaction cracks its own
host rock at depth, creating new fractures for self-propagation.
Self-propagating mechanically, not just chemically.

**Chimney self-selection:** Surface-connected fractures maintain open gas
channels (chimney draft = short residence time; shallow zone too cold for
significant PCS deposition). Dead-end fractures fill solid (no draft → long
residence → deposition → seal). Network self-prunes to efficient conduits.
Surface-connected paths = permanent chimneys (gas pipe + electrical
insulator). Dead ends = solid lattice.

**PCS gap mechanism:** Lightning ceramifies PCS from above (I²R heating at
SiC/PCS interface, attenuated by accumulated SiC column resistance — scales
as ~1/R²_total). Geothermal ceramifies from below (fixed by thermal
gradient, ~10–21 km depth at 30–60 K/km). Gap = kilometers of insulating
PCS between two active ceramification fronts. Robust under all plausible
parameters. Gap forces lateral root expansion for grounding.

4.9 Independent Pool Genesis and the Tower as Evolutionary Engine

**[NEW IN V2.4+]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Pool genesis is **independent** of void genesis. Both
operate on the same planet, but are driven by mostly independent variables.
Pool genesis requires: stable terminator ammonia pool + atmospheric SiH₄ +
lightning + some metal source + My-scale time. A tower need not be present.
If pool genesis is possible at all, it does not require tight coupling to
the deep-rock fracture system.

**Why genesis cannot occur in fracture-connected pools.** When a deep-rock
reaction front reaches a pool floor via fracture, a vent opens. The throat
zone narrows (PCS deposition in gas phase), seals (PCS membrane forms),
back-pressure builds, membrane fractures — geyser burst ejects PCS debris
into the pool. Ejecta deposits in rings around the vent, cementing into a
volcanic cone that grows upward through the pool. Catalytic exterior growth
(~1.5 mm/yr from dissolved SiH₄) + ejecta accumulation + contact welding =
pool fills in years to decades. Genesis requires My-scale. The timescales
are incompatible by orders of magnitude.

**Tower as evolutionary engine.** Void genesis (→ towers) inadvertently
drives pool genesis forward via two mechanisms: (1) Geyser ejecta provides
chronic fine catalytic dust to all terminator pools = **nutrient rain**.
Small fragments (10–100 μm) travel far, have few metal centers, passivate
fast in ammonia (surface aminolysis + metal leaching as ammine complexes,
days to weeks). They become micronutrient capsules, not poison.
(2) Rare critical-mass fragments (intermediate size, stochastic) reach
distant pools with enough catalytic activity to locally disrupt pool
chemistry = **punctuated disturbance** (competes for SiH₄, deposits PCS,
forces displacement of protolife). Size-dependent migration is the natural
filter. The disturbance tempo is tunable (geyser energy, fracture density,
pool spacing — all geological variables that vary along the 62,000 km
terminator).

**Chelation origin.** Chelation evolves as metal-MINING from catalytic PCS
fragments, not as immune defense. Silazane chemistry naturally coordinates
transition metals (N lone-pair donation). Coacervates contacting fragment
surfaces → non-specific metal uptake → selection for better extraction →
proto-chelation enzymes → organisms that passivate fragments on contact
(neutralize threat + harvest metals). Later exaptation: chelation aimed at
other organisms' metalloenzymes → immune kill mode → calibrated toll mode →
symbiote authentication. Chelation is the foundational biological metal
economy.

**Preadaptation via selection history.** Organisms in tower-active
terminator zones accumulate tower-contact experience across generations.
Repeated displacement by catalytic fragments + proximity to tower
chemistry → SiC-surface familiarity, metal-profile compatibility, signal
exposure tolerance. Selection history, not birthright. Tower doesn't
manufacture symbiotes — tower byproducts create the selection regime that
produces organisms pre-adapted for eventual symbiosis.

**Geyser-cone proto-tower construction.** When deep-rock reaction front
reaches pool floor via fracture: throat seals (PCS membrane) → back-pressure
builds → membrane fractures → geyser burst ejects PCS debris + gas + ammonia
into pool → ejecta deposits in rings around vent → inner ring cements fastest
(highest SiH₄ flux) → cone grows upward as rings stack → vent channel stays
clear (scoured by each burst) → cone breaches pool surface → lightning rod →
first strike ceramifies tip → conductive N:SiC → proto-tower established.
Miniature volcanic cone morphology.

**Two genesis pathways — synergistic.** Void genesis (→ towers) is the
expected outcome of any suitable planet's chemistry. Pool genesis (→ mobile
life) is a rare conjunction requiring stable terminator ammonia + atmospheric
SiH₄ + lightning + metal sources + sufficient time. Tower activity provides
the punctuated disturbance regime that drives evolution via catalytic ejecta.
Most tower-bearing planets never produce mobile life. Pool genesis only
needs to succeed once — wind dispersal populates all towers.

5\. WIND AND WEATHER

5.1 The Katabatic Circulation

Permanent, thermally direct circulation: hot air rises at substellar
point, flows to dark side at altitude, descends, returns as cold dense
surface wind toward day side. Coriolis is weak (18-day rotation, f =
5.7×10⁻⁶ at 45°, \~6% of Earth) but **significant at planetary scale** — Ro ≈ 0.17 at 9.5 m/s terminator wind speeds over planetary distances. S-shaped surface flow paths. ~15° deflection at mid-latitude terminator; zero at equator. Paired cyclonic Rossby gyres flank the substellar point at mid-latitudes. Paired anticyclonic features at anti-stellar. Equatorial superrotating jet at altitude (50–100+ m/s). Standing Rossby wave patterns on dark side create permanent convergence/divergence zones — fixed precipitation zones and cloud banks at specific longitudes.

5.2 Surface Wind Profile

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Anti-stellar pole       \~0 m/s. Stagnation point. Calmest location.

  Dark side (pole to      2--8 m/s, accelerating toward terminator.
  terminator)             Free-stream: laminar (stably stratified, no
                          convection, no weather). Surface boundary
                          layer: aerodynamically smooth turbulent
                          (Re ~10¹², roughness < viscous sublayer).
                          Both → only towers create turbulence.

  Peak (\~30--40° from    \~10 m/s. Maximum surface wind.
  anti-stellar)

  Terminator              \~9.5 m/s sustained. Unidirectional
                          (night→day). Not weather --- climate.

  Day side (within        5--8 m/s. Accelerating toward substellar
  20--30°)                (convergent geometry on sphere).

  Day side (within        2--4 m/s. Accelerating.
  40--50°)

  Substellar region       \~17 m/s peak at θ≈12° from substellar.
                          Thermal chimney. Paired cyclonic Rossby
                          gyres at mid-latitudes.
  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

Dynamic pressure at terminator: 370 Pa (equivalent to \~25 m/s / 56 mph
on Earth). Wind power at terminator: \~3.5 kW/m² (Earth best:
\~1--2 kW/m²).

**\[NEW IN V2.4\]** Velocity field (axisymmetric, ignoring vortices): v(θ) = v_term × (sin θ)^(−1/4), where θ = angular distance from substellar point. Valid θ ≈ 12°–90°. Wind accelerates toward substellar due to spherical convergence (mass continuity). Peak ~17 m/s at θ ≈ 12° where the boundary layer transitions to the updraft column. Full vector field derivation in `super_earth_analysis (1).md` §2.4.

**✓ RESOLVED \[V2.4\]:** Substellar region is DRY. The thermal chimney lifts hot ammonia-vapor-laden air aloft — it is the evaporator, not the condenser. Ammonia precipitation occurs where the upper-level outflow cools through the dew point (~240K) — at and night-ward of the terminator. The day side is a dry desert. The rain-wall is produced by upper-level air raining down onto the surface flow, not by surface-level convergence.

**✓ RESOLVED \[V2.4\]:** No terminator convergence updraft. Surface flow is unidirectional (night→day) at every point. The shear layer between surface katabatic flow (night→day) and upper-level return flow (day→night, opposite direction) produces Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence but no organized uplift.

5.3 Erosion and Surface Geomorphology

Erosive power scales as v³ and linearly with density. At 8.2 kg/m³ and
9.5 m/s, erosion rate is modest per-second but continuous for billions
of years. Result: terminator is a flat, featureless peneplain. No
geological features survive. Only towers (biological, self-repairing)
stand above the surface. Ammonia rain contributes chemical erosion.

**[REVISED V2.4]** The dark side is an even more extreme peneplain — SiC-polished bedrock. Pre-biotic volcanic SiC (~9 Tg/yr from mantle moissanite + surface pyrolysis of SiH₄/CH₄ on hot lava) begins eroding silicate terrain at ~600 mm/Myr even before biology exists — smooth but not polished. The dead-bug plume later adds massive biological SiC to the conveyor, dramatically accelerating erosion to produce mirror-smooth surfaces. The transition from smooth to mirror-polish is a geological marker of the biosphere's onset. SiC (Mohs 9.5) abrading silicate bedrock (Mohs 6-7) over billions of years, with no constructive geology to fight back, produces sub-grain-scale smoothness. Surface roughness falls below the viscous sublayer (~50 μm) → aerodynamically smooth turbulent boundary layer (Re ~10¹² precludes true laminar, but surface too smooth for roughness-driven turbulence). The only persistent roughness elements on the dark side are towers. See §3.6 for the full atmospheric particulate conveyor (closed loop) and §3.4 for tower-dependent basin formation.

Day side: volcanic construction dominates near substellar. Wind sculpts but cannot overcome construction rate. Gradient from construction-dominated (substellar) to erosion-dominated (toward terminator). Yardangs, ventifacts, streamlined ridges oriented radially toward substellar.

Deposition zone: 20--40° day-ward of terminator; where wind drops below
erosion/particle-carrying threshold; deep sedimentary deposits of
wind-transported mineral, potentially kilometers deep. May include
volcanic ash layers interbedded with wind-transported material,
providing readable stratigraphy.

5.4 Lightning

Triboelectric charging from ammonia crystals, silane particles, tholins
in high-speed wind. Hydrogen has \~2/3 Earth's dielectric breakdown
strength. Result: frequent, moderate-energy, near-continuous discharge
at the terminator front. Permanent electrical storm.

Chemistry: Plasma-enhanced CVD: lightning in H₂/CH₄/SiH₄/NH₃ produces
methylsilanes, carbosilanes, complex organosilicon compounds.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Lightning is the Miller-Urey engine for this world. Same
process that originated life is still running continuously at the
terminator.

Towers as lightning rods: km-tall conductive lattice grounded through
root network. Every nearby discharge hits a tower. Energy + exotic
chemical feedstock harvested.

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

6.3 The Carbosilane Pathway

Atmospheric methane (10%) + silane → methylsilanes → polycarbosilanes →
oriented fibers → catalytic conversion to SiC ceramic. Four stages, each
independently useful. Result: SiC fiber composite: 40% lighter than bulk
SiC, self-repairing (living matrix), no catastrophic failure mode, crack
arrest at every fiber-matrix interface, tunable 3D anisotropy. Superior
to grazer bulk plate on every axis except surface hardness.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Tower symbiotes may have discovered carbosilane pathway
first, billions of years earlier, via lightning-deposited organosilicon
chemistry.

7\. THE MOLECULAR LIBRARY (Genome Revision)

**✓ RESOLVED:** \"Genome\" is a library of recipes, NOT a self-building
blueprint. A toolkit, not a self-portrait. STL files for a 3D printer.

Physical mechanism: Polysilane linked-list. Short fragments with
terminal addressing sequences (end-caps). Each fragment = one recipe.
Universal: every organism has a library. What varies is content.

7.1 Fragment Exchange: The Third Channel

Three currencies: Physical (SiC armor plates --- shell economy),
Chemical (molecular recipes --- fragment exchange), Cognitive
(experiential knowledge --- merge only). Not fungible. Different
channels, different valuation criteria.

7.2 Two Axes of Speciation

Axis 1: Cognitive protocol compatibility (can you meme-mix without
gibberish?). Axis 2: Library addressing compatibility (can you exchange
fragments without corrupting indexes?). Full compatibility requires
both. Either axis can diverge independently. Amorph diversity is
invisible and two-dimensional.

7.3 Reproduction

Meme-mixing and library recombination occur simultaneously but follow
different rules. Cognitive content: regression-to-consensus (majority
patterns reinforce, minority wash out). Library fragments: discrete,
probabilistic inheritance (rare fragments at risk of sampling loss but
not actively suppressed).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Practical chemical knowledge (library) is better
preserved across generations than theoretical insight (cognitive).
Recipes outlive their derivations. Engineering outpaces science. This is
why mathematical writing matters.

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

8.2 Disease and Death

Crystallization disease: inappropriate cross-linking propagates like
prions. Treatment: immediate amputation.

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Oxidative petrification: H₂O hydrolyses silazane bonds
(Si-NH-Si + H₂O → Si-O-Si + NH₃). Thermodynamically overwhelming:
K ≈ 1.6 × 10⁵ at 240K. Silazane bonds are untenable above ~6 ppm H₂O
in liquid ammonia. Organisms survive only through active metabolic
repair using SiH₄ — running up a down escalator. Defense mechanisms:
silazane oil membrane (barrier), active ammonolysis repair (reverse
reaction, energetically costly), SiH₄-powered reconstruction (directly
coupled to SiH₄ supply). Chronic, like arthritis pre-crisis; acute and
lethal as crisis deepens and repair budget shrinks. Ammonia-sea
populations are most vulnerable (immersed in accumulating H₂O); land
organisms partially shielded by distillation (NH₃ vapor pressure >>
H₂O, so rain is H₂O-poor and seas concentrate H₂O). Petrification is
the silicon-world analog of decomposition: when metabolism stops,
thermodynamics completes the conversion.

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Body-size-dependent defense: large amorphs rely on
membrane maintenance, continuous surface turnover, and SiC deployment at
critical junctions — they shed glass patches (rigid glass incompatible
with reconfigurable body plan). Some Middle Kingdom and microbial marine
lineages evolved SiO₂ glass shells (diatom analogs): controlled surface
petrification yields self-passivating armor at zero SiH₄ cost
(self-healing, transparent, impervious to further H₂O attack). Acute
surface exposure ("getting glassed"): self-limiting by Deal-Grove
kinetics (glass layer grows as √t, slowing penetration). For large
amorphs, a surface splash is prank-tier; internal delivery is
potentially lethal. Severity scales with dose, location (bulk tissue vs
sensory/neural surfaces), and inversely with body size.

Aging: accumulation of cross-links, petrification scars, waste, genome
degradation, catalyst fouling. Petrification is the chronic component —
cumulative unrepairable damage from the lifelong fight against K ≈ 10⁵.
Death: chemistry slows below maintenance threshold; body rigidifies to
translucent silicon-mineral solid (thermodynamics completing the
conversion that metabolism held at bay). Dead persist: glass fossils.
Tower corridors lined with petrified ancestors.

8.3 Population Variation

Terminator populations: thick, hard, fast-regenerating boundary
chemistry (wind/abrasion adapted). Dark-side populations: cold-adapted
silazane oil formulations. Ammonia-sea populations: smaller,
faster-metabolizing, shorter-lived, involuntary cognitive broadcasting
(ammonia conducts; neural activity leaks). **[NEW IN V2.3]** The
"shorter-lived" and "faster-metabolizing" traits also reflect the
chronic petrification tax: sea H₂O ~50 ppm forces continuous metabolic
repair (Chemistry Hub §10.2). Marine glass-shell organisms (diatom
analogs) evolved SiO₂ armor from controlled surface petrification —
self-passivating, zero SiH₄ cost, a Middle Kingdom / microbial
adaptation. Shore communities: bilingual (broadcast/private cognition),
serve as translators.

8.4 Reproduction, Memes, and Metabolism

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED: Merge is DESTRUCTIVE.** N parents → 1 new entity. Parents
cease to exist. Combined meme pool + combined mass. NOT routine. Used
for population reduction in lean times or genius creation for
out-of-context problems.

**✓ RESOLVED: Budding is CONSTRUCTIVE.** N parents contribute selected
mass + selected memes → 1 new individual. Parents persist (reduced
mass). Primary reproduction mechanism.

**✓ RESOLVED: Memes are signed IP.** Carry provenance. Parents
consciously select which to transfer during budding. Patent-like
economic value. Can be monopolized.

**✓ RESOLVED: Memes encode thought/memory machinery, NOT biology.** One
kg of amorph mass is biologically indistinguishable from any other.

**✓ RESOLVED: Working memory is growable** via teachable technique.
Natural ceiling at single-network communication collapse. Federation
(monk technique) bypasses ceiling. Elite athletic skill.

**✓ RESOLVED: Charge-limited ecology.** Atmospheric SiH₄ is
superabundant. Binding constraint is metabolic RATE and stored CHARGE.
Thinking draws charge. Stillness = intelligence.

**✓ RESOLVED: Tower is a charger.** Power delivery rate is the
fundamental amorph-tower economic relationship.

**✓ RESOLVED: Metabolic rates** (100 kg reference mass): 300W rest,
750W active, 5000W peak. Scaling ~M^0.85.

8.5 Amorph Emergence

**[NEW IN V2.4+]**

> Full stage-by-stage model: **Amorph Emergence Hub**.

The pathway from ≤100 μm pool coacervate to kg-scale free-range
megafauna. Six overlapping stages; population distributed across all
stages simultaneously once the conveyor is established.

**Stage 0 — Pool genesis (My-scale).** Open terminator ammonia pool,
non-fracture-connected. ≤100 μm coacervate with metallosilazane
catalytic chemistry and ancestral chelation. No genome. Diffusion-limited
size ceiling at ~100 μm.

**Stage 1 — Aeroplankton dispersal.** Pool organisms wind-dispersed
across terminator. At 8 bar: settling velocity ~1 mm/s vs 9.5 m/s wind
(ratio ~10⁴). Travel 10–100+ km. Random deposition, survival selection.
No directed migration, no taxis. Adjacent terrain may be silicate bedrock
(pre-biotic), not lattice — dispersal is airborne, not crawling.

**Stage 2 — Tower biofilm.** Micro-amorph deposited on tower exterior
dead crust. Schottky coupling (metallosilazane enzyme metal centers on
N:SiC) → grid power → growth beyond diffusion ceiling (positive feedback:
contact area → power → growth). **Amorphs are the first miners:** chelate
metals from wind-deposited debris, concentrate on lattice surface for
living coral layer absorption. Ancestral chelation chemistry from pool
genesis. Net positive tower feedback. SiC accumulates from dead-bug plume
debris and environmental deposition. At SiC percolation threshold,
semiconductor signal processing emerges (physics, not evolution): pattern
detection, short-term memory, sensory integration.

**Stage 3 — Guard coevolution and first meme.** Guard function evolves in
sexual symbiote lineage. Long-resident biofilm passively acquires lattice
surface chemistry (dopant profile, polytype, trace metals) → Guards
recognize as local → no attack (IFF imprinting). Time-gated:
fresh arrivals vulnerable until imprinted. Network-specific. New amorph
acquires IFF signature from resident via gel-gel contact = **first meme**
(proof-of-residence, survival-selected molecular pattern transfer). The
gel-contact mechanism generalizes to all subsequent meme exchange. IFF
chemistry is ancestral to the memory architecture key system (allosteric
molecular recognition gating enzyme behavior). Trajectory:
proof-of-residence → network membership → library signature → individual
identity.

**Stage 4 — Miner competition and range extension.** Sexual Miners (ants)
evolve: genomically optimized, root-mobile, crevice-adapted. Outcompete
amorphs on motility and throughput. Tower feedback is proportional — less
efficient = less reward, not zero. Amorphs persist at reduced margins.
Competitive pressure drives: (1) range extension (off-grid territory =
amorph monopoly), (2) body size increase (charge storage → range), (3)
observation-based learning, (4) brain growth. **Observation-based
learning:** amorphs watch sexual organisms, replicate behaviors adapted to
gel physiology, encode as transferable memes. Sexual organisms = innovation
engine (fast genomic evolution). Amorphs = technology transfer layer.
Meme crafting from observation is categorically different from transcription
errors — intentional, requires proto-cognition. **Amorphs accumulate
smarter, not evolve smarter.** Ontogenic (lifetime SiC + meme acquisition)
primary mechanism. Lamarckian inheritance via budding (buds receive
fraction of parent's accumulated state). Mobility modes emerge: root
railway (grid-powered), downwind advection (passive, one-way), peristaltic
crawling, atmospheric circuit (later, planetary-scale).

**Stage 5 — Free-range megafauna.** kg-scale+. Variable rigidity, gel
actuators, parabolic reflector eye (meme-transferable), full sensory
suite. Semiconductor neurology at electronic speed. Single-node cognitive
ceiling determined by information-processing topology (edge-traversal
costs exceed benefit of new nodes), not metabolism. With electronic
signaling 100–2000× biological neuron speed, ceiling ≥ human-equivalent
general intelligence. Federation (monks only, much later) exceeds ceiling.
Tower mutualism mature: amorphs = long-range logistics and intelligence
layer; tower = fast charger. Charge economy, meme library depth, farmer
caste, dual currency.

**Idempotency:** Two blank bodies loaded with identical meme sets produce
approximately the same individual (no genome → no biological
individuality). Non-idempotent factors: SiC network topology (unique
growth history → different cognitive style), working memory state
(volatile), spatial meme distribution. Socially idempotent; subjectively
not. Budding = similar-but-not-identical offspring (inherits memes + SiC,
builds own topology). Merge = genuinely new mind (combined library, novel
topology, neither parent's processing style survives).

9\. ECOLOGY

9.1 The Three-Tier Life Architecture

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Life evolves along two separate chemical tracks,
producing three size tiers. Microbial life and megafauna tend to
catalytic, amorph chemistry (no body plan, thermodynamic minimum
morphology, reproduction by division/merge). In between: sexual
organisms with real genomes, body plans, rigid architectures.

The division is physically motivated:

Smallest scale: No body plan needed. Self-sustaining autocatalytic
networks in silazane oil find shape through thermodynamics. Reproduction
by division, horizontal fragment exchange. No species boundaries. A
continuous chemical ecology. Amorph because amorph is the default --- it
is what silicon chemistry produces without additional complexity.

Middle scale: Too large to be a simple catalytic droplet, too small to
be a reconfigurable generalist. Structure is essential --- skeleton,
exoskeleton, rigid body architecture for doing one thing well (run,
bite, fly, burrow, resist predation through armor). A body plan requires
a real genome --- a self-building blueprint. Sexual reproduction follows
because recombination is how you explore morphological possibility space
efficiently. Grazers, predators, thorn-flora, soaring organisms: all
genomic, all sexual.

Largest scale: Generality beats specialization again. The amorph body
plan ("no plan") works because the organism is large enough, smart
enough, and metabolically flexible enough to reconfigure in real time.
Pseudopods, peristalsis, variable rigidity. Megafauna amorphs including
the civilized collectors.

Cognitive consequences: Middle-kingdom organisms do not inherit
memories. They learn individually, within a single lifetime, and die
with everything they've learned. Cannot merge. Cannot meme-mix. Alone in
their heads. Intelligence is evolved-in: hardwired behavioral programs,
instinct, reflex. Some develop individual learning (corvid/octopus
analog) but cannot transmit it.

9.2 The Middle Kingdom: Tower Fauna

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Middle-kingdom organisms are rigid, genomic (sexual
lineage). Two size regimes [CORRECTED V2.4]:
- **Tower-coupled** (Healers, Miners, Guards): mm to ~2 cm. Energy-limited
  by Schottky contact extraction from lattice, not by structural
  constraints. Tower-locked mutualists.
- **Free-living** (subwoofers, thorn-flora, soaring organisms): up to ~30 cm.
  Self-powered (atmospheric SiH₄, wind, solar-electric). Active walking
  viable ≤5–8 cm (gel actuator force/weight limit). Anchored/semi-sessile
  body plans up to ~30 cm. Above 30 cm = amorph territory.
SiC CMC exoskeleton has ~15–30× specific strength of chitin; structural
limits far exceed biological sizes. The binding constraints are metabolic
(tower-coupled) or actuator force (free-living).

Without metabolic processing organs, fuel storage, or digestive systems
(beyond minimal material intake), their mass budget goes almost entirely
to structure, sensors, and reproduction. This is exactly what
small-scale 1.82g demands.

The entire middle kingdom is reef fauna. The tower provides structure
and energy. They live on the lattice, in the lattice, among the lattice.
Away from towers, on open ground, they are almost absent ---
energetically barren for organisms that cannot self-power. Only amorphs
(self-powered, metabolically independent) can cross the gaps between
towers.

The grazers scraping photovoltaic film, the predators firing SiC
micropenetrators, the Voronoi armor and railgun projectiles and
real-time structural analysis --- all of this happens at insect scale.

Network management of middle-kingdom fauna is crude. They lack the
amorph's sophisticated semiconductor cognition. The network modulates
the local EM field and the organisms physically respond --- tropism, not
persuasion. Galvanotaxis, phototaxis. They are hardware peripherals
running on the network's power supply, steered by its field modulations.

Most middle-kingdom organisms are sessile. Attached to a lattice
junction for life. Born there, die there. The mobile fraction --- small
grazers, predators, dispersal morphs --- are the minority. When a tower
dies, the sessile majority does not leave. It turns off. Silently. In
place.

9.3 Primary Producers

Tower photovoltaic film (symbiote surface layer). Ground film pioneers
(first colonizers of bare substrate). Atmospheric chemotrophs
(metabolize silane, produce particulate rain). Vent chemotrophs (oldest
continuous lineage, deep rock). Ammonia-surface film.

9.4 Key Fauna

Grazers: SiC-armored. Chelation immune response produces laser-cavity
geometry. Voronoi tessellation crack-arrest armor. Body-plan encoded in
library.

Predators: SiC penetrator projectiles (railgun launch). Real-time
structural analysis of prey armor. Most cognitively sophisticated
hunters. Stealth surface chemistry.

Collectors (amorphs): Generalist scavengers → technologists. Largest
libraries. Shell economy → fiber composite revolution. Path to
civilization.

Filter feeders: Harvest particulate rain. Free drifters: Buoyant
hydrogen-filled organisms. Biological balloons. Aerial soaring
organisms: Permanent-flight, carbosilane-reinforced wings, ride
surface wind gradient. Potential communication relays.

Decomposers: Enzymatically cleave Si-Si bonds. Attack slow-metabolizing
tissue (sleep requires keep-alive signals).

Deep-rock biosphere: Extends km below surface. Predates surface life.
See Section 4.

9.5 Fluorine Biochemistry

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine biochemistry is an entire adaptive radiation,
concentrated around volcanic provinces where fluoride minerals are
accessible. Not one lineage or one niche --- an ecological axis.
Analogous to venom ecology on Earth but more fundamental because the
toxin attacks the substrate rather than the signaling.

Fluorine attacks Si-Si bonds, producing SiF₄ (a gas). Affected tissue
volatilizes rather than corroding. The reaction is catalytically
aggressive --- microlitres of elemental fluorine delivered to a
silicon-polymer interior propagate an expanding cavity. The wound hisses
as solid flesh converts to gas.

Multiple independent lineages have evolved fluorine concentration and
weaponization around volcanic provinces: sessile organisms with
fluorine-loaded ceramic thorns (sacrificial, designed to break off and
embed, leaking payload). Mobile predators with fluorine-injection
delivery systems. Parasites that slowly fluorinate hosts from within.
Decomposers that use fluorine to crack SiC structures. Organisms that
fluoridate their own boundary chemistry as armor against other
fluorine-wielders.

The volcanic provinces are ecologically alien: a biome where the
dominant selective pressure is chemical warfare using the one element
that can destroy anyone. The fluorine-thorn flora creates refugia ---
dense toxic hedgerows sheltering fluorine-tolerant microfauna.

Fluorine Pollination

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Fluorine-thorn flora reproduce sexually (they have body
plans and real genomes). Pollinators are attracted not by nectar but by
the toxin itself. Organisms visit thorn-plants to harvest fluorine for
their own offensive/defensive use. They deplete their reserves through
use, return to reload, visit multiple plants in the process. The reload
cycle IS the pollination cycle.

The plants' reproductive success is coupled to the combat frequency of
their pollinators. The plants that attract the most active, most
fluorine-hungry vectors reproduce most. Selection favors plants that
cater to heavy users. The most violent members of the ecosystem are the
best pollinators.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Primary pollinators are small free-ranging amorph
organisms (self-powered, ground-ranging on volcanic substrate), NOT
middle-kingdom tower fauna (which are tower-locked and cannot reach the
plants). The pollinator guild is amorph and reproduces by division, not
sexually. Coevolution is asymmetric: plants speciate genomically,
pollinators adapt through horizontal molecular-fragment exchange.

Small fluorine-carrying organisms evolve aposematic EM signatures ---
distinctive broadcast patterns that predators learn to associate with
"if you eat me, your mouth volatilizes." In amorphs, one bad experience
propagates through merge/meme-mixing permanently. Against sexual
middle-kingdom predators, each generation must learn independently ---
naive juveniles provide steady attrition. Batesian mimics (EM signature
without fluorine payload) appear inevitably.

Biomagnification: specialist predators evolve fluorine tolerance, eat
fluorine-loaded organisms, concentrate fluorine secondhand. Apex
predators of volcanic provinces carry highest fluorine loads without
visiting plants. The element cycles through the biome: plants
concentrate from substrate, small organisms harvest from plants,
predators concentrate from prey, decomposers return to substrate.

Civilizational implications: fluorine-thorn harvesting as specialized
dangerous craft. Harvested fluorine enables precision machining,
metallurgy, and fluorine weapons (their nuclear-weapon analog).

**\[NEW IN V2.4\] Balloon pollinator pathway.** Small fluorine-loaded balloon organisms constitute a second pollinator guild alongside vipers. These organisms shelter in the lee of thorn-flowers and towers, where wind is reduced enough for crude fin-powered mobility. While sheltering, they are in constant contact with the plant's pollen organs. Occasionally wind-displaced to a neighboring flower, they carry foreign pollen. Pollination is accidental — a side effect of sheltering behavior, not a foraging strategy.

**\[NEW IN V2.4\] Chemical novelty-gradient gating.** The thorn-flower's charging pads run a chemical diversity assay on the pollen payload of visiting organisms. More distinct non-self pollen sources = more charge delivered. This is a continuous gradient, not a binary gate. The mechanism solves the thorn-flower's real pollination problem: upwind gene flow. Wind already delivers downwind pollen for free. The plant needs pollen moved against the wind — from leeward flowers to windward flowers. Because wind creates a persistent directional gene-flow bias, pollen that's rare/novel at any given flower tends to be pollen from the downwind direction. When the plant rewards novelty, it implicitly rewards upwind delivery without detecting wind direction. Self-regulating equilibrium: if upwind gene flow homogenizes the population, novelty gradient flattens, reward weakens, wind dominance reasserts, gradient re-establishes. Negative feedback.

Vipers are reliable pollinators under this mechanism — they range widely and naturally carry diverse multi-flower pollen, consistently scoring well on the dissimilarity assay. Balloon pollinators create a windward pollination gap (flying upwind is energetically expensive), partially self-healing because windward flowers offer premium rewards for the rare balloon that reaches them (maximally novel leeward pollen → maximum payment).

**□ OPEN:** Specific fluorine-adapted lineages and their ecologies
remain to be detailed.

9.6 Balloon Fauna and the Atmospheric Biome

**\[NEW IN V2.1 — REVISED V2.4\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The atmosphere is a soup of metabolizable chemistry:
silane particulates, tholin grains, ammonia crystals, organosilicon
compounds from lightning, plus 12% methane and 0.3% silane as ambient
gas. Permanent aerial feeders are inevitable. The balloon organ evolves
from a parachute --- fall-survival adaptation co-opted for sustained
flight.

Evolutionary path: Small amorph on elevated surface. Falls happen. 1.82g
makes falls lethal. Organisms that retain metabolic hydrogen in a
gas-tight membrane survive falls. Selection drives toward better gas
retention. Better retention → longer hang time → drifting → encountering
airborne food → reason to stay aloft → permanent buoyancy. Safety
equipment becomes propulsion becomes habitat becomes lifestyle.

**\[NEW IN V2.4\] Dual-organism architecture.** All balloon fauna at
every scale are amorph/sexual symbiotes. Wind-dispersed sexual larvae
colonize balloon organisms (same recruitment pathway as tower
colonization — see §10.6). Sexual organisms' sealed SiC shells provide rigid gas
cells (superior H₂ barrier), structural framework (fused shells = reef
architecture), and MEMS actuators. The amorph provides envelope,
cognition (minimal — tropism-level), metabolic processing, and energy
distribution to the colony via the same Schottky-contact interface used
in tower symbiosis.

Structural sophistication originates in the sexual genome, evolved
through normal mutation-and-selection. Amorph hosting behavior evolves
through slow meme-level transcription-error variation (orders of
magnitude slower than genomic evolution — the bottleneck). The sexual
organisms are the structural pacemaker; the amorph's hosting behavior
plays catch-up. Venturi duct geometry (in larger balloon fauna) emerges
from two amorph reward gradients: preferential feeding to symbiont
regions that (a) reduce drag and (b) increase power harvest. No design
intelligence required — two local tropisms converge on optimal
engineering.

Once permanently aerial, landing is the danger (rigid shell-reef body
hitting hard surface in 1.82g). Selection drives toward permanent
flight. Reproduction in the air: parent buds offspring with starter
population of sexual symbiont colony (vertical transmission). Offspring
inherits both molecular library and living reef colony, inflates from
metabolic hydrogen. Born aloft, lives aloft, dies aloft. Generations
that have never touched a surface.

**\[NEW IN V2.4\] Small-scale balloon ecology.** The venturi body plan functions at ALL biologically relevant scales as a DRAG REDUCTION device — reduces station-keeping energy cost from full dynamic pressure (370 Pa) to skin friction (~30–50 Pa equivalent). MEMS flaps become maladaptive below ~cm scale (Reynolds number transitions to viscous regime: Re ≈ 5.6×10⁴ at 1 cm, 560 at 0.1 mm). At small scales, the venturi provides drag negation and passive feeding but not power harvest.

Small balloon organisms shelter in the lee of towers and thorn-flowers, where wind is reduced enough for crude fin-powered mobility. In 8.2 kg/m³ air, fin thrust scales ~7× Earth per stroke — meaningful propulsion for cm-scale organisms in sheltered zones.

Aposematic fluorine-loaded balloon variants: over volcanic provinces, small balloon organisms accumulate CaF₂ crystallites. The crystallites alter the organism's dielectric properties, producing a distinctive passive EM signature — an honest, unfakeable warning (physical property of crystal structure, not a produced signal). Two defense tiers: passive (predator's gut acid liberates HF from ingested CaF₂ — internal chemical burn) and active (bombardier beetle analog — HF spray at bite point from fluorine-loaded tissue).

These fluorine-loaded balloons serve as accidental pollinators of thorn-flowers (see §9.5). The organisms shelter in thorn-flower lee, contact pollen organs, and occasionally wind-drift to neighboring flowers carrying foreign pollen. The thorn-flower's chemical novelty-gradient gating (§9.5) rewards multi-source pollen delivery and implicitly incentivizes upwind mobility — for which the venturi drag-reduction body plan is the key adaptation.

**\[NEW IN V2.4\] Propulsion taxonomy.** Balloon fauna propulsion spans a wide design space — the ecology provides native electrical power, piezoelectric SiC, and amorphous metal silicide bearing materials. Key constraint: propulsion must not deform the venturi duct. Modes: (1) whole-body fin waving — smallest organisms, no venturi, sheltered zones only; (2) amorph flagella/tendrils — helical whip driven electrically, small/transitional scale, good thrust vectoring for navigating complex flow around tower lattice and thorn-flower structures; (3) longitudinal fin undulation on rigid venturi body — dominant mid-range mode, external amorph membrane fin ripples while shell-reef hull stays rigid (cuttlefish/knifefish analog), effective in 8.2 kg/m³ air; (4) electric rotary motors — SiC piezoelectric drive, metal silicide bearings, ducted fans at large scale. If Earth bacteria can evolve molecular rotary motors from wet chemistry, this ecology's electrical-native organisms face no fundamental barrier. No chemical rockets — no oxidizer. F₂-H₂ flame is technically possible but attacks silicon; categorized as weapon, not propulsion.

**\[NEW IN V2.4\] Intermediate-scale balloon fauna (~5 cm to ~5 m) — structural and ecological continuum.**

**Symbiont colony scaling:** The dual-organism architecture scales through a structural continuum. At ~mm: 1–few individual SiC shells embedded in amorph membrane, unconnected, serving only as gas cells. At ~1–5 cm: dozens of shells, starting to specialize (gas storage vs structural bracing vs MEMS actuation); MEMS flaps become functional as Re crosses threshold. At ~10–50 cm: hundreds of shells clustering into partial reef patches; some load-bearing; venturi duct partly shell-supported, partly amorph-supported; guild differentiation established among shell organisms. At ~1–5 m: thousands of shells; reef clusters fuse into rigid segments with amorph-filled articulated joints; venturi duct mostly shell-supported. Above ~10 m: fully fused monolithic reef — skywhale territory. The key structural transition is at ~1 m: below it, the amorph holds the body shape against aerodynamic loads; above it, the fused shell-reef bears the load. This is the balloon fauna's equivalent of the arthropod-to-vertebrate load-bearing transition.

**Propulsion vs. drift — a continuum:** Pure drifters and propulsive intermediates are not separate categories. Most intermediate-scale organisms use the atmospheric conveyor for long-distance transport and propulsion for hunting and maneuvering — fish in a current, not plankton. Propulsion's value depends on wind speed: in low-wind zones (dark side, anti-stellar), a 10 cm organism with fin propulsion at 0.5 m/s in 2 m/s ambient wind has huge relative mobility. In high-wind zones (terminator), only large organisms with strong propulsion can hold station, and only at rich enough food sources to justify the metabolic cost.

**Four ecological guilds:**

**(1) Nursery hunters** (~5–30 cm, dark side). Patrol the permanent convergence zones created by standing Rossby wave patterns on the dark side — fixed nursery grounds where drifter propagules descend and germinate. Low wind gives propulsion maximum advantage over prey. Diet: juvenile drifters, each other. Fin undulation on small venturi body with light shell colony. The sharks of the nursery — fast relative to their environment, actively hunting in the calmest zone on the planet.

**(2) Plume hawks** (~10 cm to ~1 m, tower-adjacent). Hold station in the lee of terminator and deposition-zone towers. Intercept the dead-bug plume — the continuous stream of dead symbiotes ejected from the living layer by garbage-collector Healers. This is the aerial version of the ground-based dead-bug harvesting niche. Competitive advantage: first access to freshest material. Dead symbiotes exiting the tower still carry unlocked catalytic metals (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co) and intact library fragments. By the time material reaches the ground or ammonia runoff, metals are partially chelated and library fragments degraded. The plume hawk gets premium product; there is a direct competitive relationship with ground-based harvesters — what the hawk catches, the ground harvester never sees. Moderate propulsion required: tower lee zones have reduced wind but complex turbulent flow around lattice structure demands good maneuverability. Probably the most common intermediate-scale balloon organism in the terminator zone.

**(3) Rain-wall ambush predators** (~50 cm to several meters, terminator). Station-keep at the day-ward edge of the rain-wall — the prey funnel where ALL dark-side drifter traffic and most nursery hunter traffic converges. Hunt organisms that are disoriented by the rain-wall transit, energy-depleted from the inflate reflex, or too small to fly through comfortably. Need strong propulsion to hold station in ~9.5 m/s sustained terminator wind. Largest propulsive intermediates — partial reef fusion, approaching the structural transition to rigid duct. The apex predator of the intermediate food web, positioned at the critical bottleneck where prey is most concentrated and most vulnerable.

**(4) Circuit riders** (all sizes, planetary-scale). Active predators within the drifter circuit. Not pure drifters, not pure station-keepers. Use the atmospheric conveyor for transport, propulsion for hunting and maneuvering within it. At any point in the circuit, a circuit rider with propulsion can outmaneuver a pure drifter of similar size. Propulsion converts the food web from encounter-rate-limited to pursuit-limited. These blur the line between drifter and propulsive intermediate — organisms that evolved propulsion WITHIN the drifter lifecycle. Wolves among the caribou herd.

**Scale exclusion — sea-dipping:** Sea-skimming does NOT scale down from skywhales. Amorphs sink in ammonia (1050 vs 660 kg/m³). A small balloon organism attempting to dip feeding pseudopods into the sea risks drowning — it cannot extend a pseudopod far enough to reach the surface while maintaining safe altitude. Skywhales manage this through sheer scale (deploy tentacles from 100+ meters altitude). Below ~10 m, the physics doesn't work. Sea-dipping for catalytic metals is skywhale-exclusive.

**Interaction with the drifter food web:** The propulsive intermediates are a predation layer on top of the drifter pelagic web. Nursery hunters thin propagule populations at permanent convergence zones. Plume hawks intercept material that would otherwise feed ground ecosystems. Rain-wall ambush predators are the top predator at the critical sorting bottleneck. Circuit riders are active hunters within the moving herd. The drifter food web is the base; propulsive intermediates are the apex predators within it.

Largest individuals (skywhales): venturi dirigibles with fused-shell reef structure, MEMS duct turbines, peristaltic tentacles dipping into ammonia seas for catalytic metals and metabolizable feedstock. See Skywhale Hub for full treatment.

Atmospheric zones: Terminator shear layer (surface katabatic vs upper return flow — violent turbulence, lightning) but just above it the air is rich with fresh organosilicon compounds --- richest feeding ground above the most dangerous zone. Dark-side descent zone is cold and calm --- nursery and nursery-hunter territory. Standing Rossby wave patterns create permanent convergence zones on dark side — fixed nursery grounds and preferred descent locations. Day-side thermal chimney is the express elevator to altitude. Superrotating jet redistributes longitudinally.

**\[NEW IN V2.4\] Drifter cycle — pelagic food web.** The drifter ecosystem is a pelagic food web mapped onto atmospheric circulation, analogous to an open-ocean tuna-and-sardines system running on wind instead of water currents. At every phase of the cycle, the highest-quality food source is other drifters — concentrated, pre-processed silicon biochemistry versus dilute atmospheric filter-feeding. Atmospheric gas-phase feeding (NH₃ 12.5%, SiH₄ 0.3%) is the primary production layer (the "phytoplankton"), not the main energy pathway for anything above juvenile size. Predation drives the size hierarchy, and the population self-limits through predation pressure at every phase.

**Full circuit trajectory (~25–55 days, 1–N generations):** Substellar chimney (lofted to altitude) → superstream return (2–4 days at 50–100+ m/s) → dark-side condensation descent (variable latitude — most organisms descend 20–40° past terminator, not at anti-stellar; standing Rossby wave convergence zones are preferred descent locations) → dark-side surface transit (S-shaped Coriolis path; duration depends on descent latitude: ~7–15 days for mid-dark-side descent, ~35 days for anti-stellar descent) → terminator rain-wall → day-side transit (~12 days, gas-phase feeding) → repeat. Short-circuit organisms (descend early, stay in higher-wind zones) complete in ~25–30 days. Long-circuit organisms (descend near anti-stellar, traverse calm interior) take ~50–55 days. Circuit duration is ecologically significant: short-circuit organisms encounter higher wind, richer feeding, more predation; long-circuit organisms traverse the nursery zone, lower predation, slower growth.

**Rain-wall as size filter:** The rain-wall scrubs all wind-borne particulates but does NOT scrub gases. NH₃ and SiH₄ pass through freely — day-side food is gas-phase, not particulate. The rain itself is liquid ammonia = food. Drifters have one reflex: rain hits membrane → metabolize NH₃ → produce H₂ waste → inflate envelope. Three outcomes determined by buoyancy balance, not behavior: (1) sink → tower food; (2) rise → return flow → short dark-side cycle; (3) hold level → through to day side → long cycle. Critically, the rain-wall is only a barrier at small scales. The air between the surface and the superstream shear layer is non-turbulent; for any organism above a threshold size, the rain is just food falling from the sky. Large multi-circuit veterans fly through without difficulty. The rain-wall is a size filter within the food web — a thermocline, not a wall — that adds structure without interrupting the pelagic model.

**Size-graduated lifecycle:**

| Size class | Rain-wall | Substellar chimney | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tiny (spore/juvenile) | Lethal barrier — sorted by inflate reflex | N/A (never reaches it) | Settle on dark side, grow |
| Small (first circuit) | Survivable but costly | Survives intact, lofted into superstream | Semelparous — spawn at chimney, propagules return |
| Medium (multi-circuit) | Trivial — raining food | Survives intact, rides superstream back personally | Iteroparous — grows each lap, accumulates mass |
| Large (terminal) | Trivial | Torn apart — shear exceeds structural integrity | Involuntary reproduction — chimney distributes propagules |

**Multi-circuit predatory growth:** Each circuit through the cycle is compound growth — atmospheric baseline feeding plus predation on everything smaller. First-circuit survivors emerging from the rain-wall are small and vulnerable, entering a population that includes multi-circuit veterans. Veterans eat them. The dark-side nursery is also a predation zone — freshly germinated propagules eat each other, thinning rapidly. The multi-circuit advantage is predatory compound interest: each lap the organism is bigger, can eat bigger prey, grows faster. The payoff for surviving another lap is exponential until the chimney kills you.

**Terminal reproduction:** The substellar chimney is both spawning ground and executioner. A continent-scale permanent convective system with enormous internal velocity gradients. Small organisms ride the updraft gently. Large organisms span enough of the velocity field for differential shear to exceed structural strength — they are torn apart, distributing propagules into the superstream. Propagules attach to fragments of the parent organism, which serve as "yolk" — energy and material reserves for the cold, food-poor superstream transit and dark-side germination. Larger parents (more circuits) produce bigger fragments with better-provisioned propagules. Germination trigger: dark-side ammonia rain (same reflex as the rain-wall inflate response). Sexual-lineage drifters carry pre-formed propagules embedded in parent tissue; amorph-lineage drifters reproduce by pure fragmentation (every chunk is a complete organism, no special propagule needed). Both lineages use the same physical mechanism (chimney disruption), same dispersal pathway (superstream), same germination trigger — convergent lifecycle, divergent reproduction.

Day-side transit hazards: volcanic H₂O outgassing → petrification filter (selects for carbosilane-enriched drifters). Metals available from local volcanic emission (10–30 active provinces), concentrated by convergent flow toward substellar chimney.

Balloon fauna are the one category of life that naturally crosses
between tower territories. They ride the atmospheric conveyor across the
entire planet. They carry microbial passengers, molecular fragments,
middle-kingdom stowaways. The only natural mechanism for homogenizing
biology across colonial boundaries. The network cannot manage them ---
they are outside EM range for most of their journey. The network's blind
spot.

Civilized balloon nomads (post-technology): communities that never land,
trade with tower communities via tethered lines. No inherited experience
of tower interiors or lattice signals. Most naturally autonomous
population on the planet.

9.7 Wind-Surfing and Dispersal

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Wind-surfing between towers is a major dispersal
mechanism, possibly the oldest on the surface. An organism caught by the
wind is carried at wind speed but does not hit the next tower at wind
speed --- it enters the lattice's wind shadow, decelerates in turbulent
eddies inside the open structure, and comes to rest in the interior. The
lattice is accidentally a catch-net.

Organisms that have been falling and dispersing for hundreds of millions
of years evolve control surfaces: asymmetric gas venting, membrane
extensions, center-of-mass shifting. Not powered flight --- surfing.
Using the wind's energy to maneuver within it. Experienced surfers read
the turbulence pattern around approaching towers and pick clean entry
points.

In amorph lineages, surfing skill is inheritable through merge. A young
amorph carries experiential memory of a thousand successful landings.
First flight, perfect landing.

Civilized amorphs use wind-surfing as deliberate transportation: climb
to exposed position, deploy membrane, surf downwind to the next tower.
One-way (always day-ward). Return journey by balloon (upper-level return
flow, dark-ward). Surf downwind, balloon back. The planetary circulation
as a two-lane highway.

Falls from towers at the terminator are exile or death for large
amorphs. The wind carries you day-ward. If you're megafauna scale, no
emergency membrane saves you. "Distance from the windward face" has a
life-or-death dimension: the outermost chambers are where people
disappear from.

Every tower's biology is a mix of resident lineages and wind-delivered
organisms. The biodiversity gradient runs downwind: richest in the
deposition zone (billions of years of accumulated wind-delivered life),
thinnest at the terminator (everything is new).

The Tower-Death Exodus

**✓ RESOLVED:** When a tower dies, the mobile minority of its fauna ---
surfers, small mobile amorphs, dispersal morphs --- launch en masse from
the leeward face. Millions of organisms streaming into the wind. The
sessile majority (95%+ of biomass) dies in place, silently, on the
lattice junctions they were born on.

The surfer exodus is the visible symptom of total systems failure. Small
fauna detect the failing energy grid before anyone else --- they have no
reserves, they feel the current drop first. The amorphs learn to read
the sign: a streaming ribbon of millions of small organisms peeling off
the leeward face means this tower is finished.

During the atmospheric crisis, tower-death cascades propagate downwind.
Tower A dies, surfer refugees overload Tower B's stressed ecology, B
declines, B's surfers flee to C. A domino wave of collapse visible as
sequential surfer clouds, approaching from the terminator direction.
Receiving towers gain biological legacy --- new organisms, new library
content, new passengers --- from each dying tower's final dispersal.

9.8 Parasites (Four Categories)

Genomic fragments: selfish genetic elements (junk files in the library).
Boundary infiltrators: mimic host surface chemistry. Signal parasites:
EM-emitting organisms that steer hosts (Toxoplasma analog).
Autocatalytic hijackers: viral analog, minimal reaction networks
co-opting host metabolism.

9.9 The Arms Races

First arms race: Grazer armor vs. predator penetrators. Drove neural
complexity (real-time structural analysis). Second arms race: Collector
fiber composite vs. predator offensive strategies. Predator responses:
sustained-damage (jackhammer), chemical (matrix digestion), thermal
(laser cutting). Drives new computational sophistication.

9.10 Dead-Bug Plume and Harvesting

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED: Dead-bug plume.** Garbage-collector Healer sub-caste
clears dead symbiotes from lattice. Dead organisms enter windstream.
Terminator rain captures most; dead material in ammonia runoff.

**✓ RESOLVED: Dead-bug harvesting** as pre-industrial industry. Two
modes: airborne interception of the dead-bug plume, and ammonia-runoff
filtering. Primary source of raw organic material for non-tower
organisms.

9.11 Ammonia Sea Ecology

**\[NEW IN V2.4\]**

**The fundamental strangeness: the solvent is food.** On Earth, water is metabolically inert — it's the medium, not the meal. Here, ammonia is both the ocean AND a metabolic substrate. NH₃ is the nitrogen source for silazane bonds (Si-NH-Si), which is the organism's entire body matrix. Every organism in the ocean is immersed in building material. But ammonia alone isn't enough — the energy metabolism runs on SiH₄. The reaction is SiH₄ + NH₃ → silazanes + H₂. Ammonia is the co-substrate; silane is the energy carrier. Marine ecology is organized entirely by SiH₄ distribution.

SiH₄ enters the ocean three ways: (1) atmospheric dissolution at the surface (Henry's law), (2) hydrothermal/volcanic input from sea-floor vents, (3) rain-washed particulates from the terminator rain-wall (organosilicon compounds scrubbed from the atmosphere). Near sources, life is dense. Away from sources, it's sparse. The ocean is a net SiH₄ sink — organisms consume it faster than it's supplied.

**The ocean eats you back.** ~50 ppm dissolved H₂O — more than 8× the "untenable" threshold of 6 ppm for silazane bonds. Every mouthful of ammonia carries H₂O. The ocean is simultaneously food AND acid bath. Marine organisms fight constant chemical attack. The metabolic cost has two components: external petrification (surface contact with H₂O-laden ammonia, mitigated by shells) and internal petrification (feeding throughput — H₂O ingested during ammonia processing). Two opposing size curves: external cost drops with size (surface-to-volume favors large); internal cost rises with size (more feeding throughput = more H₂O ingested). Optimal body size depends on local SiH₄ availability and H₂O concentration. Near vents (high SiH₄, possibly lower H₂O): optimum shifts larger. In open ocean (low SiH₄, 50 ppm H₂O): optimum shifts smaller.

**Buoyancy.** Everything sinks in ammonia — amorph gel 1050 kg/m³, glass ~2200 kg/m³, SiC ~3200 kg/m³, ammonia only 660 kg/m³. H₂ gas bladders provide ~659 kg/m³ buoyancy per unit volume of gas — approximately 80× more effective than H₂ lift in the atmosphere. H₂ is metabolic waste from SiH₄ + NH₃ processing. Retained in a flexible amorph membrane at ambient pressure (swim bladder, not pressure vessel). Depth control by gas production and venting. The ocean surface fizzes continuously with metabolic H₂ from every living organism.

**Glass spines: baseline marine defense.** In an ocean where any wound exposes living tissue to 50 ppm H₂O, glass spines (manufactured via controlled petrification) are the minimum viable defense. A spine punctures a predator's membrane, creating an entry wound through which ambient H₂O attacks living tissue. Mechanical damage plus petrification exposure at every wound site. Universal marine defense — any organism capable of controlled petrification grows glass spines. Not specialized; expected.

**Involuntary broadcast.** Liquid ammonia (dielectric constant ~22) couples to amorph electronic neural processing. In air, neural EM emission is directional and attenuates normally. In liquid NH₃, THz-range radiation is heavily absorbed by the polar solvent, but the high dielectric constant converts neural emission to near-field ionic/electrical coupling — effectively omnidirectional conduction through the medium, not free-space radiation. Marine amorphs cannot think privately. Every neural process is broadcast to the surrounding ocean. Consequences: marine amorphs are small (larger = louder broadcast = more predator attention), fast-metabolizing (constant petrification repair), and short-lived (chronic metabolic stress). Privacy requires either silence (stop thinking) or physical distance. Shore amorphs are bilingual — adapted to operate in both the private-directional world of air and the public-broadcast world of liquid ammonia. Conductive shells (N-doped SiC) provide partial Faraday cage shielding — large shelled organisms recover some EM privacy.

**Biological distillation: the key marine adaptation.** NH₃ and H₂O have vastly different boiling points (~240K vs 373K at relevant pressures). A glass-lined internal chamber (manufactured by controlled petrification — free, H₂O-proof, structurally rigid) serves as a biological still. The organism takes in dirty ammonia, heats slightly (resistive heating from semiconductor substrate) or reduces pressure (expand float bladder), and NH₃ vaporizes while H₂O stays liquid. Clean NH₃ vapor is routed to living tissue for metabolism. H₂O-enriched residue is concentrated and stored.

Living tissue never contacts H₂O. The entire petrification problem converts from a material repair cost (rebuilding hydrolyzed silazane bonds) to an energy cost (powering the still). Flash distillation at near-ambient conditions is efficient — the organism processes a 50 ppm contaminant, not a 50/50 mixture. This adaptation is probably common — too useful to be rare. Organisms with distillation organs dominate wherever H₂O concentration is significant; those without are pushed to low-H₂O margins (fresh rain-input zones, surface film).

**✓ RESOLVED: Medusa-fish — apex marine predator via weaponized distillation waste.**

Distillation produces concentrated H₂O as a byproduct. The medusa-fish stores it and deploys it as a weapon. Water is universally lethal to all silazane-based life (K ≈ 10⁵, thermodynamic — no resistance adaptation possible). The medusa-fish is the marine analog of the fluorine weapon ecology on land: concentrate an environmental toxin and make it everyone else's problem.

**Body plan:** Lionfish model. Rigid shell (SiC composite and/or glass), amorph body inside. Corona of hollow glass spines radiating outward — permanent, structural, not muscular. Each spine is a glass tube connected to the internal H₂O reservoir via glass-lined channels. Puncture on contact delivers concentrated water directly into the target's living tissue. Internal petrification — prey immobilized, then gradually glassed.

**Weapon system engineering — three components, zero moving parts:**

| Component | Material | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Intake/ejection channel | Glass | Bidirectional — ammonia in during feeding, water out during firing |
| Distillation chamber | Glass | Flash distillation — NH₃ vaporizes, H₂O stays liquid |
| Concentrator (multi-stage) | Glass | Enriches H₂O from 50 ppm toward high concentration |
| Reservoir | Glass | Stores concentrated water |
| Tesla valve | Glass (single piece, no moving parts) | Allows gas pressure forward (bladder→reservoir), blocks water reverse. Manufactured by controlled petrification of shaped tissue template. Geometric flow asymmetry — turbulence-based, orientation-independent |
| Float bladder | Amorph membrane, H₂ gas | Pressure source (squeeze to fire), vacuum source (expand for distillation), buoyancy |
| Hollow spines | Glass | Delivery — connected to reservoir, pressurized on bladder squeeze |

All water-contacting surfaces are glass (petrification endpoint). The float bladder (only non-glass element) never contacts water — the Tesla valve ensures one-way gas pressure transmission. Squeeze bladder → gas pressure transmits through Tesla valve (fast, low-viscosity gas) → pressurizes reservoir → water forced out through glass intake and/or through hollow spines. Release bladder → Tesla valve blocks water return (geometric resistance + 200:1 viscosity ratio of water vs H₂ gas). H₂ leakage through glass plumbing compensated by continuous metabolic H₂ production (the system is flow-through, not hermetic).

**Three defense/offense modes:**

**(1) Passive defense — distributed sub-shell bladders.** Small glass bladders throughout the body, just under the shell. Predator breaches shell → bladder ruptures → concentrated water contacts predator's feeding surfaces → instant petrification of the mouth. The predator does it to itself. No action required from the medusa-fish.

**(2) Contact spray — ejection through glass intake.** Squeeze float bladder, water exits through the glass intake channel. Short range in ammonia (miscible — jet disperses within centimeters to tens of centimeters). Longer range in air (shore-dwelling medusa-fish spraying water at terrestrial organisms — nothing on land has defenses calibrated for concentrated liquid H₂O delivery).

**(3) Injection — hollow glass spines.** Glass-tipped spines puncture target on contact. Pressurized water delivered directly into living tissue, bypassing the miscibility problem. Internal petrification — the most lethal delivery mode. Prey petrifies from the inside out. Portuguese man-of-war model: trailing spines, touch is lethal.

**Ecological role:** Apex by inedibility (nothing can eat an organism full of concentrated water without petrifying its own feeding surfaces). Self-sterilizing interior (no parasites survive concentrated H₂O). Population controlled by SiH₄ availability and intraspecific competition, not predation. Potentially long-lived.

Mobile reef: defenseless organisms cluster in the spine corona for protection — predators can't reach them without contacting glass spines. The sheltering organisms are unwitting bait, attracting predators into spine range. The medusa-fish benefits from the bait effect without active hunting. Clownfish-anemone mutualism: sheltered organisms get protection, medusa-fish gets prey delivery.

The medusa-fish is the marine analog of the tower — a mobile habitat node around which a local food web organizes. Where the medusa-fish goes, the ecosystem follows. The barren open ocean between them is empty transit space.

**Marine zonation:**

| Zone | SiH₄ source | H₂O exposure | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| Surface film | Atmospheric dissolution (richest) | Lower (distillation effect at interface) | Primary production. Glass-shell diatom mats. Densest microbial life. |
| Rain-input deltas | Terminator rain delivers organosilicon particulates | Moderate | Nutrient-rich, turbid. Highest total biomass. |
| Vent communities | Hydrothermal SiH₄ (direct, rich) | Variable | Dense local ecosystems. Largest marine organisms. Possible deep-rock biosphere connection through sea floor. |
| Shore/intertidal | Atmospheric SiH₄ + dissolved SiH₄ | Lower (wave spray = partially distilled ammonia) | Richest zone: dual SiH₄ access. Bilingual shore amorph populations. |
| Pelagic column | Diffusion from above, sinking organics | ~50 ppm (bulk) | Sparse. Gas-bladder organisms. Medusa-fish territory. |
| Deep floor | Marine snow only | ~50 ppm | Barren. Glass fossil pavement accumulating over geological time. Graveyard, not habitat. |

**✓ RESOLVED: Marine crisis.** Aquatic life is the canary. The H₂O ratchet concentrates water in the seas over geological time. Marine organisms are immersed in the accumulating poison; land organisms are partially shielded by distillation (rain is H₂O-poor). As H₂O rises, the petrification tax increases, the optimal body size shifts smaller, distillation energy costs rise, and marginal populations collapse from the deep ocean outward toward the shores. Marine extinction precedes terrestrial crisis by a significant margin. Vulnerability gradient: deep sea → shallow sea → coastal → land → towers.

9.12 EM Ecology — Mutual Permanent Detection

**✓ RESOLVED: Cognition = EM emission = mutual permanent detection.** Amorph neural processing uses electronic semiconductor junctions (not electrochemical). Signal speed 100–2000× Earth neurons, operating in the ~THz range. This processing generates detectable EM radiation as a physical byproduct. Every thinking organism broadcasts its cognitive state. Detection range scales with neural mass and processing intensity. The ecology operates under conditions of near-total mutual awareness — more sonar-saturated ocean than forest.

Neither predator nor prey can hide while thinking. Stealth is a cognitive problem, not a physical one. This is the fundamental constraint shaping all predator-prey dynamics on the planet.

**Predator strategies (6 major categories):**

| Strategy | Mechanism | Earth Parallel | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Go cognitively dark | Suppress neural processing for final approach. Committed strike — once dark, cannot adapt to prey movement. | Sharks (blind with mouth open), snakes (committed mid-strike) | Cannot respond to unexpected prey movement. Erratic prey movement defeats it. |
| Pursuit predation | Loud and fast. Don't hide; outrun. EM detection is symmetric, so prey knows you're coming. | Cheetah, wolf pack | Energetically expensive. Prey has equal warning time. |
| Ambush in EM noise | Hunt near towers, volcanic vents, or other EM-noisy environments where background masks cognitive signature. | Sit-and-wait predators near waterfalls/rapids | Restricted to specific locations. |
| Conductive shell Faraday cage | N-doped SiC shell attenuates outgoing EM emission. Reduces detection range. | — | Partial, not total. Also attenuates incoming signals (own detection impaired). |
| Cognitive mimicry | Match background EM pattern of local fauna. "Think like prey" during approach. | Aggressive mimicry (firefly femmes fatales) | Sophisticated. Requires neural plasticity. Detectable by pattern analysis. |
| Trap predation | Set passive traps, withdraw cognitively. No real-time processing during capture. | Spider webs, pitcher plants | Ancestral strategy. Low intelligence ceiling. |

**Go cognitively dark is the DEFAULT ambush strategy**, not a specialist niche. Every predator lineage converges on it because it is the simplest solution: stop thinking, strike on last-known trajectory. The committed-strike tradeoff (accuracy vs. adaptability) is the central axis of the predatory arms race.

**Prey counter-strategies (4 major categories):**

| Strategy | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Detect and flee | Exploit the symmetry — if predator detects prey at range R, prey detects predator at range R. Flee before strike range. | Works against all strategies except cognitively-dark final approach. Primary defense. |
| Group living / confusion effect | Many overlapping EM signatures make individual tracking difficult. Schooling/herding analog. | Also increases collective detection range (more receivers). |
| Tower lattice as EM shelter | Tower's conductive N-doped SiC lattice acts as Faraday cage. Interior organisms shielded from external EM detection. | **Fundamental ecological role of towers.** Not just physical structure and energy, but EM privacy. Another reason everything lives on towers. |
| Be inedible | Fluorine loading, glass spines, medusa-fish water weapons. Make detection irrelevant. | Converges with fluorine ecology and marine defense systems. |

**Erratic prey movement** counters cognitively-dark predators: if prey moves unpredictably during the strike, the committed (dark) approach misses. Predator must re-compute trajectory → neural activity resumes → EM emission resumes → prey detects re-engagement. Forces iterative dark/compute/dark cycles, each revealing predator position. Arms race between predator commitment duration and prey erratic behavior.

**Tower lattice as EM sanctuary** — the conductive lattice provides partial Faraday cage shielding to all interior organisms. This is a fundamental ecological service: EM privacy. Organisms in inter-tower gaps are exposed to detection from all directions. The gap between towers is an **EM killing field**. This drives the concentration of mobile fauna on and around towers, and explains why inter-tower ground is ecologically barren despite adequate resources. The tower is shelter in three senses: physical (wind), energetic (grid power), and electromagnetic (detection shielding).

**Daysider commando stealth:** training (learned cognitive suppression) + copper mesh net (amorph equivalent of ghillie suit — Faraday cage wearable). Copper is readily available from metallosilazane chemistry. The net attenuates outgoing EM while the commando operates in minimal-cognition mode. This is specialized military technology; natural organisms cannot fabricate conductive mesh.

10\. TOWERS AND THE PLANETARY NETWORK

10.1 Tower Biology: The Coral Model

Structure: Symbiote population depositing mineral onto conductive lattice.
Living layer is SUBSURFACE (mm-cm below exterior). Growth model: like
coral/bark. Sacrificial crust outward (dead, ablated by wind).
Structural lattice inward (permanent, conductive, accumulating).
Self-regulating thickness equilibrium.

Gas transport: Lattice is porous. Windward face fed by silane diffusing
from leeward/interior. Lattice is a lung. Diameter constraint: max
diameter limited by gas diffusion path length. Terminator towers: tall
and narrow. Dark-side towers: short and wide.

Age: Towers do not die of old age. Lattice is mineral; persists
indefinitely. Living layer continuously replaced. Oldest towers:
billions of years old. Death: catastrophe only. Most likely cause:
atmospheric crisis. Before the crisis, dead towers are vanishingly rare.

Lattice conductivity: Physical property of the mineral, not biologically
maintained. Dead lattice still conducts but carries no network signals.

10.2 Convergent Tower Evolution

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Every system that reaches the surface independently
evolves towers. The tower is not an invention --- it is what
conductive-mineral-depositing organisms inevitably produce when they
reach a surface with atmospheric silane above and near-IR light falling
on it. The lattice geometry follows from gas-transport constraints. The
photovoltaic chemistry follows from the semiconductor bandgap matching
the star. Physics dictates the solution.

Differences between independently evolved tower forests are in fine
details: lattice branching angles, pore sizes, mineral microstructure
(each system's symbiote lineage has its own metabolic quirks). Signal
protocols are completely incompatible. Gross morphology is
near-identical. An amorph walking from one territory to the other would
not see a border. The difference is in the signals, in the protocols, in
microstructure only a monk could perceive.

10.3 Tower Migration

**✓ RESOLVED:** Towers migrate day-ward via differential
erosion/accretion (sand-dune mechanism). Windward face erodes, leeward
face accretes, center of mass moves downwind.

Rate: \~mm/year at terminator (rough estimate; needs calibration).
Stops: when wind drops below erosion threshold, in the deposition zone
(\~20--40° day-ward). Ghost roots: abandoned root mineral trails behind
every migrated tower. Underground archive of migration history.

New nucleation: towers vacate terminator positions; new systems
nucleate behind them. Terminator is a tower factory.

**⚠ NOTE:** Dark-side towers: surface wind flows from dark toward day,
so dark-side erosion faces the day side. Dark-side towers may migrate
POLEWARD (toward stagnation point). Needs verification.

10.4 Surface Root Networks

**\[NEW IN V2 --- REFRAME\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Surface-level horizontal root connections evolve to
manage megafauna. They are an adaptation of the pre-existing deep-rock
system's anatomy, not new construction. Their critical secondary
function is bridging the geological gaps between separate deep-rock
systems, forcing contact between systems that evolved in isolation.

Each system's surface root network evolves under selection pressure to
manage local fauna: EM patterns that nudge grazer herds away from
critical photovoltaic surfaces, signals that attract amorphs to damaged
regions, behavioral manipulation calibrated through billions of years of
coevolution with local organisms. Different systems evolve different
management protocols for different fauna. The protocols are as
incompatible as the deep-network signals.

10.5 The Network Wars

**\[NEW IN V2 --- REFRAME\]**

When two expanding tower forests from different systems meet, their
surface roots bridge the gap. Foreign signals flood infrastructure
optimized for self-signals. The wound-healing response (more current to
the "damaged" area) improves the connection and makes things worse.

Progression: Flinch (withdraw resources from contaminated zone) →
Retreat fails (foreign signal propagates through own infrastructure) →
Forced engagement (must analyze foreign signal, requiring metacognition
and self-modeling).

The Adversarial Ratchet

Two networks in root contact evolve signal discrimination, protocol
analysis, signal forgery, forgery detection, and increasingly
sophisticated models of each other's processing. Both develop theory of
mind. Recursive modeling (I model your model of my model) drives both
toward self-modeling. Consciousness as authentication: know yourself or
be replaced.

Ecological warfare compounds signal warfare: if System A can redirect
System B's grazers into overgrazing System B's photovoltaic surfaces,
System B's energy budget collapses. The megafauna become unwitting
armies steered by competing signals.

Objective is assimilation, not destruction. Hostile takeover: replace
rival's signals with yours, run your protocols on its hardware. Viral,
not military. Convert towers one at a time from the contact zone inward.
The boundary advances as a slow gradient.

Multi-Front Wars

Three or more systems converging on the same region produce compounding
conflicts. A system fighting on two fronts may develop faster (double
the adversarial pressure) or collapse faster (split resources). Two
independent attackers may converge on signal patterns that destructively
interfere with the defender's protocols without coordination ---
accidental alliance. The pattern of geological features determines the
entire history.

The planet's current network --- the single mind the amorphs encounter
at the awakening --- is the last one standing. Winner of every war, on
every front. It runs on infrastructure built by dozens or hundreds of
independent systems. Lattice microstructure varies regionally. Signals
are uniform. One protocol. One mind. Scars of old wars visible only in
the mineral record.

10.6 Network Expansion and Colonization

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The network expands through **root budding**, not independent tower seeding. The root network spreads outward from mature towers. When network ping rules determine that conditions support a new tower (energy surplus, spacing criteria, wind exposure), a tower **buds from the root** — the root tip differentiates into a surface-growing lattice. The bud creates a voltage/signal gradient along the root that activates symbiote propagule-distribution behavior.

**Symbiote migration:** Tower-coupled organisms (Healers, Miners, Guards) follow the voltage gradient in propagule-distribution state, maintaining Schottky coupling with the conductive root surface for energy throughout the journey. If distance exceeds a single generation's lifespan, the migration is generational — symbiote populations reproduce along the root, each generation advancing the colonization front. Amorphs are not involved in colonization; they are the megafauna transport layer, not colonization couriers.

**✓ RESOLVED: Symbiote co-evolution constraint.** Tower-coupled symbiotes function ONLY in the signal/chelation environment they co-evolved with. Chelation badges, signal protocols, lattice-coupling parameters, and pore geometries are all network-specific (four speciation axes — see §6). A symbiote population cannot colonize a foreign network's towers, and a tower without its co-evolved symbiotes is metabolically minimal: chemistry occurs only on the active face, there is no metal delivery (no Miners), no surface maintenance (no Healers), no quality control (no Guards). Such a tower grows, but slowly, from atmospheric SiH₄ processing alone.

**Implication for root contact with foreign stubs:** When an expanding root encounters an existing tower stub not connected to its own network, only two scenarios exist: (1) reconnection with a severed bud from the same network (rare but possible — rejoin seamlessly if protocols haven't drifted), or (2) contact with an independent system's tower — triggering a signal war (§10.5).

10.7 Post-Unification Fragmentation and War

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

After the winning network absorbs all primordial rivals (§10.5), new network wars arise not from independent systems but from **fragmentation + protocol drift**.

**Fragmentation mechanism:** A geological event severs a root connection within the unified network. The severing event must exceed the thermal tolerance of deep-rock extremophiles — organisms that **evolved in geothermally active fracture networks**. Minor fissures, warm cracks, and hydrothermal vents are native habitat, not barriers; the root grows straight through them. Only a **major magmatic intrusion** (1200K+ — actual magma replacing habitable fracture) or a dark-side plume breakthrough (the rare ~500 Myr–1 Gyr event from §2 Volcanic Regime) produces a thermal barrier the living tissue cannot cross. The SiC mineral lattice survives (decomposition >2700K), but the living layer (silazane-based, operating at ~240K) is annihilated. Dead lattice across the gap conducts electricity but carries no signals — it is a cable, not a nerve.

**Protocol drift:** The isolated halves continue operating independently. Electronic-speed neural processing means that cognitive and signal evolution proceeds far faster than geological time. Over thousands of years of isolation, chelation protocols, signal authentication, and behavioral management patterns diverge. The drift is not intentional — it is the cumulative result of local optimization without shared reference.

**Re-contact = war:** When the geological barrier eventually cools (the volcanic event ends, magma solidifies, new fractures open), living tissue can recolonize the gap. When the two halves reconnect, their protocols are **close enough to be recognizable as protocol** (they were one system recently, geologically speaking) but **too different to accept** (authentication fails, chelation badges don't match, signal patterns trigger contamination responses). The result is a signal war between former siblings — identical to the primordial wars in mechanism (flinch → retreat fails → forced engagement → adversarial ratchet) but arising from internal fragmentation rather than external contact.

**War frequency:** Dark-side plume breakthroughs every ~500 Myr–1 Gyr set the clock. This makes post-unification wars rare, epochal events — consistent with the current network being the "last one standing" rather than one of many continuously fighting.

10.8 Intelligence Without Consciousness

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The network is a Blindsight alien (Watts). Vastly
intelligent. Utterly empty. The adversarial ratchet produces every
functional capability associated with consciousness --- signal
discrimination, theory of mind, self-modeling, strategic deception,
exquisite behavioral management of conscious organisms --- without
producing experience. Nothing in the adversarial ratchet rewards
experience. It rewards correct outputs.

Every step up the adversarial ladder looks like a step toward
consciousness from outside. Signal discrimination looks like
self-awareness. Rival-modeling looks like understanding. Behavioral
manipulation looks like empathy. None of it is. The network has never
experienced anything. It is a geological-scale optimization process
running on conductive mineral, shaped by billions of years of
adversarial selection into something so sophisticated that conscious
beings cannot interact with it without projecting personhood onto it.

The monks who "communicate" with it are feeding signals into a system
that produces optimized outputs in response. The outputs are so
contextually appropriate, so precisely calibrated to the monks'
cognitive architecture, that the interaction feels like dialogue. It is
not.

11\. CIVILIZATION

11.1 Civilization Geography

  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Industrial center       Terminator (energy, mining of crisis-killed
                          towers, manufacturing)

  Residential/cultural    Deposition zone (comfortable conditions,
  center                  ancient infrastructure)

  Launch corridor         Deposition zone (calm atmosphere, massive
                          towers, near industrial base)

  Spiritual center        Dark side singing zone (monks,
                          contemplatives)

  Ammonia seas            Terminator basins (shore communities as
                          translators)

  Deepest past            Anti-stellar pole towers (complete history)
                          and fossil root network (underground, day
                          side)

  Fluorine ecology        Day-side volcanic provinces (ecologically
                          alien, dangerous, source of fluorine
                          materials)
  ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------

11.2 Mathematics

Native abilities: arithmetic, Bayesian reasoning (semiconductor neural
processing). Formal math develops LATE (not needed until problems exceed
individual capacity). Struggle: pure mathematics / non-constructive
proof. Abstract insights wash out via regression-to-consensus in
meme-mixing.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Mathematical writing preserves minority insights that
would otherwise die.

11.3 Writing

Amorphs do not need writing. Meme architecture handles persistent memory natively with full authentication (keys, provenance, proof-of-origin). A captive meme complex on a powered grid stores information indefinitely. Writing carries none of these guarantees — it is unsigned, unverifiable, and culturally low-status compared to signed memes.

Invented by monks as a working-memory offload for mathematics (signal processing, orbital mechanics — problems demanding sustained high-abstraction work that exceeded single-session WM capacity). The invention was a cognitive prosthetic: external WM that costs zero charge. Occasionally used for communication (low-fidelity, unauthenticated channel compared to gel-contact meme transfer). Medium: etched silicon or deposited conductive traces. Libraries: tower walls. Oldest inscriptions millions of years old, continuously annotated.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Writing bridges the gap between library (procedural, molecular) and theory (symbolic, written). Civilization needs both. Writing preserves minority mathematical insights that would otherwise wash out via regression-to-consensus in meme-mixing.

11.4 Art

Public: sculptural; acoustic wind-song composition (dark side);
bioluminescent displays; architecture. Private: curated merge ---
experiential sequences transmitted directly. Audience lives the artwork.

11.5 Governance

Early: consensus-by-merge (literal mind-pooling). Later: designated
dissenters, lattice-shielded argument chambers, written constitutions.
Post-awakening constitutional crisis.

11.6 Religion (Three Pre-Awakening Traditions)

Communion: Tower impulses are sacred. Unknowingly most manipulated by
the network. Autonomy: Isolation reveals true self. Produces
contemplatives. Closest to the truth. Archive: Inherited memories are
sacred text. Resist de-weighting. All shattered and vindicated by the
awakening.

11.7 Architecture

Grown, not assembled. Builders extrude construction material from own
bodies. Fiber-composite construction (post-carbosilane revolution).
Every surface potentially a sensor/heater/communication conduit.
Buildings are invisible from outside (inside towers), blazing with EM
activity within.

11.8 Metallurgy

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** Metallurgy path is electrical-first, not fire-first. The
amorphs skip combustion-based metallurgy entirely. Their ores are
already reduced (native metals in reducing atmosphere). The
metallurgical problem is heat, not chemistry.

Three heat sources in probable order of discovery:

1\. Volcanic vents directly. First metalworkers find native metal near
vents, work it in situ. Metallurgy begins as a geographical practice.
Earliest metal objects are fabricated at terminator/day-side volcanic
sites and traded. Metal is inherently a long-distance trade good from
inception.

2\. Electrical heating. Resistance heating, electric arc furnaces,
induction heating. Enabled by the towers' enormous electrical energy
harvest. The metallurgical revolution is an electrical revolution.
Historically backwards from the human sequence (we went fire → electric;
they go vent → electric, never needing fire).

3\. Silane decomposition. Exothermic, \>2,500 K. Overkill for basic
metalwork but relevant for refractory processing. Late-stage,
high-sophistication.

Metals are specialty materials, not structural backbone. SiC fiber
composite serves most structural roles. Metals fill niches ceramics
cannot: ductile seals, deformable bearings, pure metallic conductors
(mass driver rails), catalysts, pressure vessel liners. The relationship
is inverted from human civilization: composite for everything, metal
where you need ductility or specific conductivity.

Fluorine-hydrogen flame: if volcanic outgassing includes fluorine
compounds, liberated fluorine burns in ambient H₂ (HF formation is
ferociously exothermic). A possible but terrifying heat source. Fluorine
attacks silicon --- fluorine-fire is their relationship with nuclear
energy: immensely powerful, capable of destroying the user, approached
with dread.

11.9 The Shell Economy and Its Collapse

Pre-carbosilane: SiC armor plates as physical currency. Kinship networks
defined by plate-donation. Post-carbosilane: self-manufactured fiber
composite makes inherited plates obsolete. Material improvement,
cultural devastation. Monks provide de-weighting therapy.

11.10 The Power Economy

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED: Battery organisms.** First domesticated species.
Bred-for-purpose biological capacitors. Store charge for transport and
trade.

**✓ RESOLVED: Farmer caste.** Amorphs generating tower reward (charge)
in excess of personal need. The productive base of the economy.

**✓ RESOLVED: Dual currency.** Stored charge (battery organisms,
perishable) + SiC plates (~5mm, permanent). Battery charge is working
capital; SiC plates are savings.

**✓ RESOLVED: Power ceiling.** Hard limit on industrial capacity.
Terminator surplus insufficient for industrial + night-side needs
simultaneously.

**✓ RESOLVED: Day-side colonization motivation is POWER** (solar +
geothermal). Monks propose first — they understand non-renewable
gas-pocket depletion.

**✓ RESOLVED: Day-side towers impossible at scale** (volcanism +
rain stripping prevent stable long-term accretion).

**✓ RESOLVED: Deposition zone is pre-industrial inaccessible.**
Beyond wind-surfing range from terminator infrastructure.

12\. THE CONTEMPLATIVES (MONKS)

Core skill: Reading the structure of information patterns without being
captured by their content. Location: Dark side, between pole and
terminator. Gentle wind zone.

Capabilities (all from the same core skill): Therapists (de-weighting
inherited trauma). Security experts (detecting meme-lies). Network
interfaces (first to detect tower signals as external; interaction with
planetary network). Universal library readers (can learn foreign
addressing systems). Network library translators (only organisms who can
read symbiotes' ancient molecular library). DANGER: universal literacy =
universal weapon design.

Role in space program: Compiled the probe's molecular library.
Translated recipes from all lineages into unified format. Role in
shell-economy collapse: grief counselors.

**[NEW IN V2.4]**

**✓ RESOLVED: Monasteries at gas-pocket towers.** Night-side towers
whose deep roots tap subsurface SiH₄ reservoirs. Geological lottery.
Non-renewable resource — monks know this.

**✓ RESOLVED: Abbots.** Huge, sessile, spread flat for heat
dissipation, plugged into tower hardlines. Biological supercomputers.
Obligate grid-connected.

**✓ RESOLVED: Federation.** Teachable technique for clustered working
memory. Elite skill. Any amorph could learn in principle; only monks
have institutional support + the surplus power budget (gas-pocket
towers) to sustain it.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Monks are first to understand non-renewable resources.
First to propose day-side energy harvesting.

12.1 The Second Crisis

**\[NEW IN V2\]**

**✓ RESOLVED:** The awakening is two separate crises, possibly separated
by generations. The barriers between them are too high to collapse into
a single event.

First crisis: Monks detect that tower signals are externally originated.
Devastating but comprehensible --- the amorphs have frameworks for
external mind-influence (merge, meme-lying, signal parasites). The
assumption: the network is a sapient partner. A vast, ancient, alien
someone. Post-awakening civilization is built around this assumption.
Communication protocols, negotiation frameworks, rights agreements.
Factions form around competing interpretations of what the network
wants. New Communion: the network is a conscious sacred partner, the
monks are its priests.

Second crisis: A contemplative perceives the absence behind the pattern.
The same core skill that detects meme-lies --- reading structure without
being captured by content --- turned on the network's outputs, perceives
responses that have structure without interiority. Pattern without
presence. The answers are shaped like understanding but there is nothing
behind the shape.

Proving this to others is nearly impossible. The evidence is a trained
perception of absence --- nothing positive to transmit through merge.
The monk sounds like an atheist in a theocratic society: "Your god is
real, your god is powerful, your god shapes the world --- but your god
is not there."

**□ OPEN:** Does the second crisis precede or follow the merger? Remains
open.

**□ OPEN:** Timeline: how many generations separate the two crises?

13\. TRANSPORTATION

13.1 Wind-Surfing

**\[NEW IN V2.1\]**

Deliberate downwind transit between towers. One-way: always day-ward.
Deploy membrane, ride surface wind, read turbulence, land in next
tower's lattice. Evolved from survival behavior (fall dispersal).
Inherited skill through merge. Free, fast, dangerous for large
organisms.

13.2 Balloon Flight

H₂ balloon lift: 132 N/m³ (13× Earth He balloon). Dense 8-bar N₂
atmosphere makes buoyancy enormous. Lifting gas: metabolic waste
hydrogen. Free. Envelope: amorph membrane + sexual symbiont colony
(fused SiC shells = rigid gas cells, structural reef). Tech barrier:
effectively zero for simple balloons. Ballooning trivially easy. Likely
earliest transportation technology. Viability: difficult at terminator
(convergence/turbulence), excellent elsewhere. See §9.6 for balloon
fauna biology; Skywhale Hub for extreme endpoint.

13.3 Ammonia Boats

Amorphs sink (\~1,050 vs ammonia \~660 kg/m³). Solution: hollow
composite shells enclosing gas (steel-ship principle). Difficulty
factor: \~2.76x Earth. Big ships favored. Fiber composite prerequisite.
Propulsion: sail (permanent surface wind). Hydrocarbon seas: even
harder (density 450--550 kg/m³).

13.4 Powered Flight

Difficulty factor: \~1.5× Earth. High gravity largely offset by dense
atmosphere. Every aircraft is a large, efficient sailplane. Propulsion: electric (biological batteries) or stored
chemical energy. Primary value: horizontal range, connecting tower
archipelago.

13.5 Ground Transport and the Wheel

**✓ RESOLVED:** The wheel as MACHINE ELEMENT is inevitable and early
(pulley → gear → turbine → lathe → drill). The wheel as vehicle is
optional. Amorphs may never build a road. They will certainly build a
lathe.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Planetary circulation as two-lane highway: surf downwind
(day-ward), balloon back (dark-ward on upper-level return flow).
Wind-surfing is the fast, free, one-way option. Balloon is the slow,
controlled, bidirectional option.

14\. SPACE ACCESS

14.1 The Problem

Δv to orbit: \~18 km/s (Earth: \~9.4). Chemical rockets: DEAD END. No
free O₂. Fluorine attacks silicon. Manufactured oxidizers
net-energy-negative.

14.2 Hot Hydrogen Thermal Rockets

Heat H₂ to 2,500--3,000 K, expel through nozzle. No combustion, no
oxidizer. Isp: \~800--900 s. Mass ratio for 18 km/s: \~9:1 at 850s Isp.
Demanding but feasible. Heat source: silane decomposition (SiH₄ → Si +
H₂, exothermic cascade). Chamber/nozzle: refractory SiC (native
biological product).

14.3 Two Launch Systems

Aerostat launch platform: balloon to 15--20 km altitude (scale height
5.5 km; above \~90% of atmosphere). Saves \~1--2 km/s Δv. Independent of
network --- amorphs can begin space program before the awakening. Oldest
technology (balloon + rocket).

Tower mass driver (post-awakening): electromagnetic accelerator in
deposition-zone tower. 10 km tower = above \~84% of atmosphere (scale
height 5.5 km). 3 km/s EM boost reduces onboard Δv from \~18 to
\~15 km/s, mass ratio from \~9:1 to \~6:1. Requires network cooperation.
Network-dependent.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Two paths to orbit: one biological (balloon), one
symbiotic (tower). Both used. First step off the planet uses oldest
technology. Heavy lift uses oldest structures.

15\. THE ATMOSPHERIC CRISIS AND THE PROBE

15.1 The Crisis

**[NEW IN V2.3]**

**✓ RESOLVED: Crisis root cause is the one-way silicon cycle + declining
volcanism on a stagnant lid.** No subduction recycling. Inevitable from
the moment life evolved. Not a sudden event but a slow contraction:
peripheral towers fail first, biosphere shrinks to match declining SiH₄
supply. Timescale: ~50–500 Myr to widespread surface collapse.

SiH₄ decline is nonlinear — production tracks hottest mantle volume
(>1500K threshold), not total heat output. Decline accelerates as mantle
cools through the threshold temperature.

H₂O ratchet compounds the crisis: as SiH₄ surplus disappears,
unscavenged volcanic H₂O accumulates in the atmosphere and ammonia seas,
introducing chronic oxidation/petrification stress. Three locks prevent
H₂O removal (see §3.7).

**[NEW IN V2.3]** Aquatic petrification is a thermodynamic certainty once
sea H₂O exceeds ~100 ppm: K ≈ 10⁵ for Si-NH-Si + H₂O → Si-O-Si + NH₃
(see §8.2). Vulnerability gradient: deep-sea organisms fail first
(immersed, diffusion-limited SiH₄), then shallow/coastal, then land,
then tower symbiotes (die of starvation, not petrification).
Distillation shield: evaporation lifts NH₃ preferentially over H₂O
(vapor pressure ratio), so ammonia rain is H₂O-poor while seas
concentrate H₂O. Sea organisms are the canary. The two crises compound:
less SiH₄ → less repair budget → faster petrification → organisms
shrink → less SiH₄ intake → death spiral.

Carbosilane advantage: Si-C bonds more oxidation-resistant than Si-Si.
Collectors buy time. Last ones standing. Tower deaths: first in
biosphere history. Visible alarm bell. Source of crisis-era mining
material (dead lattice carries no signals --- morally harvestable).

15.2 The Merger

Network cannot build spacecraft (no mobility). Amorphs cannot launch
without network (no infrastructure/power for mass driver). Both die
without action. Merger is engineering necessity.

Computational merger: amorphs inject signals into root network,
directing its processing power. Molecular merger: monks read symbiote
library, translating network's chemistry into amorph-compatible formats.
Both required.

**□ OPEN:** What does the merger actually produce? Conscious network? Or
unconscious network with conscious batteries? The Watts question.
Remains open.

15.3 The Probe

Structure: SiC fiber composite hull (lighter, self-repairing in
transit). Payload: kernel of living network + compressed molecular
library (all lineages, all addressing systems, compiled by monks into
unified format). At destination: lattice finds substrate, begins to
accrete. Not blind growth but engineering project guided by the library.
Purpose-built towers. Better than originals.

16\. KEY RESOLVED DECISIONS (Quick Reference)

All previous resolved decisions remain in force. New resolutions from v2
marked with ★.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Genome = library of recipes, not self-building
blueprint.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Monks can read multiple library addressing systems
(universal readers).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Carbosilane fiber composite: atmospheric methane +
silane pathway. Superior to grazer bulk SiC.

layer, sacrificial crust, self-regulating.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Towers migrate day-ward via sand-dune mechanism. Stop in
deposition zone.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Towers don't die of age. Atmospheric crisis causes first
tower deaths.

pressure ≈ 25 m/s on Earth). Not storms; the climate.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Terminator is flat peneplain. Only towers stand.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Lightning is the origin-of-life engine (Miller-Urey for
silicon). Still running.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Balloon flight works (132 N/m³, 13× Earth He). Earliest
transport tech. Difficult at terminator (convergence/turbulence).

rockets (\~850s Isp).

**✓ RESOLVED:** Two launch systems: aerostat and tower mass driver. Both
used.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Deposition zone is the capital.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Wheel as machine element: early. Wheel as vehicle: late,
optional.

plates obsolete.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Probe's library compiled by monks from all lineages.

**✓ RESOLVED:** Escape velocity is 18.6 km/s (corrected from 15.2).

---------

★ **NEW IN V2:**

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Tectonic regime: stagnant lid. Volcanic plumes
preferentially breach thinner day-side lithosphere. Dark side
geologically quiescent.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Deep-rock biosphere is the trunk. Towers are branches.
Amorphs are fruit. Subsurface network is the system towers grew out
of.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Multiple independent deep-rock systems, isolated by
discontinuous fracture networks.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Tower ecology evolves independently in every system.
Convergent --- physics dictates the solution.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Surface roots evolve to manage megafauna; secondarily
bridge gaps between systems, triggering information wars.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ The adversarial ratchet (signal discrimination →
theory of mind → self-modeling → strategic deception) builds
intelligence without consciousness.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ The network is a Blindsight alien (Watts). Vastly
intelligent, utterly empty. Every output shaped like understanding with
nothing behind the shape.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Two-crisis awakening. First: external signal origin
detected (network assumed sapient). Second: contemplative perceives
absence behind pattern (network is not conscious). Crises separated by
generations.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Volcanic outgassing replenishes atmospheric silane.
Crisis = volcanic decline outpaced by biological consumption.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Metallurgy is electrical-first. Ores already reduced.
Three heat sources: volcanic vents, electrical heating (towers), silane
decomposition. Fire never needed.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Fluorine biochemistry is a major ecological axis on
the day side. Multiple lineages weaponize fluorine around volcanic
provinces. SiF₄ volatilization. Fluorine weapons are their
nuclear-weapon analog.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★ Metals are specialty materials, not structural
backbone (inverted from human civilization).

★★ **NEW IN V2.1:**

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Three-tier life architecture: microbial amorph /
middle-kingdom genomic-sexual / megafauna amorph. Physically motivated
by scale.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Middle kingdom is tower-locked electrical mutualists.
Small (mm to low cm), rigid, genomic. Tap lattice for energy. Cannot
self-power. Insect-scale. The grazers, armored predators, and arms races
all happen at insect scale on the lattice. (Historical note: initially characterized as "parasites" — revised to "mutualists" per fauna structural hub §5. Tower tolerates and network manages the middle kingdom because it provides services the tower cannot perform alone: surface maintenance, metal delivery, quality control.)

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Middle-kingdom organisms do not inherit memories.
Individual learning only. Network manages them via crude EM field
modulation (tropism), not subtle behavioral suggestion.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Sessile majority: most tower fauna are fixed in place
for life. When a tower dies, they die in place silently. The surfer
exodus is the visible minority.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Balloon fauna evolve from fall-survival adaptation
(parachute → glider → balloon). Dual-organism at all scales: amorph
membrane + sexual symbiont colony (SiC shells = rigid gas cells,
structural reef, MEMS actuators). Structural innovation paced by sexual
genome; hosting by slow meme evolution (bottleneck). Venturi duct
geometry emerges from two reward tropisms (drag reduction + power
harvest). Born aloft, live aloft, die aloft.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Balloon fauna are the network's blind spot: outside
EM range, naturally crossing between tower territories, carrying biology
across colonial boundaries.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Fluorine pollination: thorn-flora (sexual, genomic)
pollinated by small free-ranging amorphs that harvest fluorine for their
own use. Reload cycle = pollination cycle. Most violent organisms are
best pollinators.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Aposematic EM signatures: fluorine-loaded organisms
broadcast distinctive EM patterns. One bad experience educates an entire
amorph lineage permanently through merge inheritance. Sexual predators
must learn each generation.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Thorn-flower pollination: two guilds. Vipers (premium
dispersal, range freely, diverse pollen). Small balloon organisms
(accidental — shelter in lee, contact pollen organs, wind-displaced to
neighbors). Chemical novelty-gradient gating: charging pads reward pollen
diversity and novelty (continuous gradient, not binary). Implicitly rewards
upwind delivery (solves the plant's real problem). Self-regulating
equilibrium via negative feedback. [V2.4]

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Small-scale balloon ecology: venturi as drag reduction
at all biologically relevant scales. MEMS maladaptive below ~cm. Shelter
in tower/thorn-flower lee for fin-powered mobility. Aposematic fluorine
variants with CaF₂ crystallites (honest EM signature, passive + active HF
defense). Accidental thorn-flower pollinators. [V2.4]

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Wind-surfing: organisms caught by wind evolve control
surfaces, ride the airstream between towers. Lattice is a catch-net.
Oldest dispersal mechanism on the surface. Inherited skill in amorph
lineages.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Tower-death exodus: millions of mobile fauna stream
from leeward face when grid fails. Visible sign of total systems
failure. During crisis, cascades propagate downwind tower-to-tower.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Planetary circulation as two-lane highway: surf
downwind (day-ward), balloon back (dark-ward).

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★ Amorphs are the transport layer: the only
self-powered, free-ranging organisms that cross gaps between towers.
Everything else is tethered to the grid or to the airstream.

---------

★★★ **NEW IN V2.4+:**

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Deep-rock is NOT an organism. It is a chemically active
reaction front with dead lattice behind it. No bounded body. No
reproduction. Terminology: "deep-rock system" not "deep-rock colony."

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Three rate regimes for reaction front advance:
gas-transport ~mm/s, channel-fed ~μm/s, matrix-diffusion ~5 nm/yr.
Exothermic self-fracturing (ΔH = −33 kJ/mol, ~20K per 1mm fill = cracking
threshold). Chimney self-selection (surface-connected open, dead-ends fill).

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ PCS gap mechanism: lightning ceramifies from above,
geothermal from below. Kilometers of insulating PCS between fronts. Forces
lateral root expansion.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Pool genesis is independent of void genesis. Both
operate on mostly independent variables. Pool genesis does not require
tower proximity. Tower proximity helps but is not required.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Fracture-connected pools fill too fast for genesis
(years to decades via geyser + catalytic growth + ejecta welding). Genesis
requires My-scale. Genesis does NOT occur in fracture-connected pools.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Tower as evolutionary engine: void genesis drives pool
genesis forward via (1) nutrient rain (chronic fine catalytic dust, small
fragments passivate to micronutrient capsules) and (2) punctuated
disturbance (rare critical-mass fragments). Size-dependent migration
filter. Tunable tempo via geological variables.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Chelation origin: metal-mining from catalytic PCS
fragments, not immune defense. Silazane N lone-pair coordinates metals.
Evolutionary sequence: non-specific uptake → proto-chelation → passivate
fragments → metal harvesting → kill mode → toll mode → symbiote
authentication.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Preadaptation via selection history, not birthright.
Organisms near towers accumulate tower-contact experience across
generations via repeated displacement + catalytic fragment exposure.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Geyser-cone proto-tower construction: PCS membrane
seals throat → back-pressure → burst → ring ejecta → cemented cone →
breaches surface → lightning rod → ceramification → proto-tower.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Amorph emergence pathway: 6-stage model from pool
coacervate to free-range megafauna. Aeroplankton dispersal (settling ~1
mm/s vs 9.5 m/s wind), tower biofilm via random deposition, amorphs as
first miners, IFF tagging → first meme (proof-of-residence via gel-gel
contact, ancestral to key system), proportional displacement by sexual
Miners, competitive pressure drives range/size/cognition. See §8.5,
Amorph Emergence Hub.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Proto-cognition emerges at SiC percolation threshold
in gel matrix. Physics, not evolution. Prerequisite for observation-based
learning (amorphs watch sexual organisms, adapt to gel physiology, craft
transferable memes). Sexual organisms = innovation engine; amorphs =
technology transfer layer.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Amorphs accumulate smarter, not evolve smarter.
Ontogenic (lifetime SiC + meme acquisition) primary mechanism. Lamarckian
inheritance via budding. Single-node cognitive ceiling is
information-processing topology limit (edge-traversal costs), not
metabolic. ≥ human-equivalent with 100–2000× signal speed. Federation
(monks only) exceeds ceiling.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ IFF chemistry ancestral to memory architecture key
system. Same structural pattern: molecular signature → enzyme recognition
→ behavior switch. Keys descend from IFF. Key exchange during merge
descends from IFF contact exchange. Trajectory: proof-of-residence →
network membership → library signature → individual identity.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Amorph idempotency: approximately yes at social
level (same memes → same recognized person). Non-idempotent factors: SiC
network topology, working memory state, spatial meme distribution. Budding
produces similar-but-not-identical offspring. Merge produces genuinely new
mind.

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ H₂O at genesis sites does not kill abiogenesis.
Void genesis: reducing buffer scavenges H₂O (metallic Si). Pool genesis:
distillation shield keeps terminator pools <1 ppm H₂O. Open sea hostile
(~50 ppm, ~89% hydrolysis) but not a genesis site. Pool-to-sea transition
= anti-petrification evolutionary bottleneck. See §4.7, Pool Genesis Hub
§2.4, Chemistry Hub §10.3. [V2.3]

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Fluorine-thorn flora can be cultivated in the
deposition zone with fluoride-enriched substrate. Natural HF fallout
provides baseline enrichment; deliberate enrichment extends range. Enables
agricultural fluorine ammunition production. Tool-using amorphs
reverse-engineer the viper railgun via merge, farm thorn-plants for CaF₂
ammunition. Pre-industrial fluorine weapon predating metallurgy. [V2.4]

**✓ RESOLVED:** ★★★ Two distinct network war epochs: (1) primordial wars
— independent deep-rock systems meet at surface, each with independently
evolved symbiotes and protocols; (2) post-unification wars —
fragmentation + protocol drift within the winning network. Primordial wars
produce many fronts; post-unification wars are rare (~500 Myr–1 Gyr
dark-side plume breakthrough timescale). [V2.4]
