## Q1: MANTLE SiC FORMATION

### Approach

In a reducing mantle at the iron-wustite (IW) buffer, metallic silicon and dissolved carbon coexist. The question is whether SiC (moissanite) forms as a stable phase at mantle P/T conditions, and in what abundance.

### Key Thermodynamics

SiC is thermodynamically stable relative to metallic Si + dissolved C at temperatures below ~2500K at moderate pressures. The Gibbs free energy of formation:

```
Si(metal) + C(graphite/dissolved) -> SiC(3C)
dG_f(298K) = -65.3 kJ/mol
dG_f(1500K) ~ -30 kJ/mol  (less favorable at high T, but still negative)
dG_f(2500K) ~ 0 kJ/mol   (approximate stability limit)
```

At mantle temperatures (1400-2000K) and pressures (5-50 GPa), SiC is thermodynamically stable when both metallic Si and free C are available. The question is kinetic: does it nucleate and grow in the magma?

### Terrestrial Analogs

On Earth, moissanite is exceedingly rare -- found in kimberlites, ophiolites, and some meteorites. Concentrations in terrestrial mantle xenoliths: ~0.1-10 ppm by mass where found at all. But Earth's mantle is more oxidizing (near QFM buffer, ~2 log units above IW), so metallic Si is essentially absent, and carbon exists primarily as CO2/CO/carbonate, not as free C or dissolved C in metal.

### This Planet's Mantle: More Favorable

This planet's mantle differs from Earth's in three critical ways:

1. **Reducing conditions at IW buffer**: metallic Si is a stable phase (established in spine)
2. **Dissolved carbon in metallic Si**: at IW, carbon dissolves in the metallic Si-Fe alloy phase at ~0.5-2 wt% (similar to carbon in iron at similar conditions)
3. **No oxidizing sinks**: carbon cannot escape as CO2; it stays reduced

SiC nucleation requires supersaturation as the metal alloy cools. During magma ascent, the Si-Fe-C alloy blebs cool and carbon solubility decreases, driving SiC precipitation -- analogous to diamond precipitation from Fe-C-Ni melt in kimberlites, but for SiC in a Si-rich system.

### Quantitative Estimate

Consider a magma with 2-5% metallic Si by mass (consistent with IW buffer in a silicate melt), and the metallic Si phase containing ~1 wt% dissolved C:

- Carbon available per kg of metallic Si: ~10 g
- SiC from that carbon: 10 g C x (40/12) = ~33 g SiC per kg metallic Si
- Fraction of erupted magma that is metallic Si: ~2-5%
- SiC fraction of total erupted magma: 0.02 x 0.033 = **~0.07%** by mass (range: 0.03-0.15%)

However, not all dissolved C precipitates as SiC. Competing sinks:
- C remains dissolved (quench-trapped): ~30-60% (rapid ascent freezes alloy)
- C forms graphite on alloy grain boundaries: ~10-30%
- C forms SiC: ~20-50% of dissolved C

**Revised estimate: SiC in erupted magma ~ 0.01-0.08% by mass (central: ~0.03%)**

This is 100-1000x higher than terrestrial moissanite concentrations but still a trace phase.

### Grain Size

Mantle-formed SiC would be fine-grained (10-500 um) -- crystallized from rapidly cooling metallic blebs during magma ascent. Some may be larger (mm-scale) from slow crystallization at depth. The fine fraction is relevant for aeolian transport.

### Verdict: WEAKLY SUPPORTS monadnock model concern

Mantle SiC is real but small. At ~0.03% of erupted magma, it contributes a non-negligible SiC component to the volcanic particulate budget. This source alone does not threaten the monadnock, but it is not zero.

### Uncertainty: MODERATE
Biggest unknown: what fraction of dissolved C in the metallic Si alloy actually precipitates as SiC vs. remaining trapped. Range spans roughly an order of magnitude (0.01-0.1%).

## Q2: SURFACE PYROLYSIS SiC

### Approach

Fresh lava surfaces (~1400K, cooling over hours to days) are exposed to an atmosphere containing SiH4 (0.024 bar partial pressure) and CH4 (0.8 bar). At temperatures above ~1000K, gas-phase and surface reactions produce SiC:

```
SiH4(g) + CH4(g) -> SiC(s) + 4H2(g)    dG(1400K) ~ -180 kJ/mol (strongly favorable)
```

This is the basis of industrial CVD SiC production.

### Hot Surface Area Estimate

At 80-100 km^3/yr magma production across 10-30 provinces:

- Assume average flow thickness: 5 m (shield volcano pahoehoe flows)
- Surface area per km^3 of lava: 10^9 m^3 / 5 m = 2 x 10^8 m^2 = 200 km^2
- Total fresh surface per year: 90 km^3/yr x 200 km^2/km^3 = **18,000 km^2/yr**
- But this surface is hot (>1000K) only briefly. Cooling timescale for a 5 m flow:
  - Conductive cooling: t ~ L^2 / (4 * kappa), kappa ~ 10^-6 m^2/s
  - t ~ 25 / (4 x 10^-6) ~ 6 x 10^6 s ~ 70 days for core
  - Surface cools much faster: surface drops below 1000K in ~1-3 days for a 5 m flow (radiative + convective cooling in 8 bar atmosphere)
  - Effective hot-surface lifetime: ~2 days at >1000K

- Instantaneous hot surface area: 18,000 km^2/yr x (2/365) ~ **100 km^2** = 10^8 m^2

### SiC Deposition Rate from CVD

Industrial CVD of SiC from SiH4 + CH4 at 1000-1400K and ~0.001-0.1 bar partial pressures gives deposition rates of ~0.1-10 um/hr. These rates are for optimized reactor conditions.

On a volcanic surface, conditions are suboptimal:
- Reactant delivery: boundary-layer limited, not supply-limited
- Wind disrupts stagnant boundary layer (enhancing mass transport but also carrying product away)
- Surface is rough basalt, not a polished substrate

At the planetary SiH4 partial pressure (0.024 bar) and T ~ 1200K (midpoint of the hot window):

The rate-limiting step is SiH4 delivery to the hot surface. Mass transfer coefficient in turbulent flow:

```
k_m ~ D * Sh / L
Sh ~ 0.037 * Re^0.8 * Sc^0.33 (turbulent flat plate)
```

For wind at ~5 m/s (day-side wind speed), air density 7.4 kg/m^3 (day-side), viscosity ~2 x 10^-5 Pa*s:
- Re per meter ~ rho * v / mu = 7.4 * 5 / (2e-5) = 1.85 x 10^6 /m
- D(SiH4 in N2/H2 at 1200K, 8 bar) ~ 2 x 10^-5 m^2/s (high T increases D; high P decreases it; rough estimate)
- Sc = mu / (rho * D) = 2e-5 / (7.4 * 2e-5) ~ 0.14
- For L ~ 100 m flow segment: Re = 1.85 x 10^8
- Sh ~ 0.037 * (1.85e8)^0.8 * 0.14^0.33 ~ 0.037 * 1.6e6 * 0.52 ~ 31,000
- k_m = D * Sh / L = 2e-5 * 31,000 / 100 = 6.2 x 10^-3 m/s

SiH4 flux to surface:
```
J = k_m * C_SiH4 = 6.2e-3 * (P_SiH4 / RT)
P_SiH4 = 0.024 bar = 2400 Pa
T ~ 1200K
C_SiH4 = 2400 / (8.314 * 1200) = 0.24 mol/m^3
J = 6.2e-3 * 0.24 = 1.5 x 10^-3 mol/(m^2*s)
```

Not all SiH4 arriving at the surface reacts to form SiC. The sticking/reaction probability on a rough basalt surface at 1200K is perhaps 1-10% (lower than optimized CVD reactors where it can approach 100% on Si substrates). Take 3%.

```
SiC deposition flux = 0.03 * 1.5e-3 = 4.5 x 10^-5 mol/(m^2*s)
= 4.5e-5 * 40 g/mol = 1.8 x 10^-3 g/(m^2*s)
= 1.8 mg/(m^2*s)
```

Over the ~2 day hot window:
```
SiC deposit per unit area = 1.8e-3 * 172,800 s = 311 g/m^2 ~ 300 g/m^2
```

At SiC density 3210 kg/m^3, this is a film ~100 um thick. This is plausible -- industrial CVD deposits um-scale films in hours; here we have days at favorable partial pressures.

### Total Annual SiC Production via Pyrolysis

BUT: this 300 g/m^2 deposits ON the lava surface. What enters the atmosphere as particulate?

The deposited SiC film is brittle and poorly bonded to the underlying basalt (thermal expansion mismatch: SiC alpha ~ 4 x 10^-6/K, basalt alpha ~ 8 x 10^-6/K). As the surface cools through the 1000K-300K range, thermal stress spalls the SiC film. Wind abrasion of the fresh, cracking surface entrains SiC flakes.

Assume ~50% of the deposited SiC eventually enters the atmospheric particulate load (some is buried by subsequent flows, some is too firmly bonded):

```
SiC entering atmosphere = 300 g/m^2 * 0.5 * 18,000 km^2/yr
= 150 g/m^2 * 1.8 x 10^10 m^2/yr
= 2.7 x 10^12 g/yr
= 2.7 Tg/yr
```

However, I need to reconsider the effective hot area. The 18,000 km^2/yr is total annual fresh surface, and each point is hot for ~2 days. The deposition calculation already uses the per-point hot-window duration, so:

```
Total annual SiC production (pyrolysis) = 150 g/m^2 * 1.8e10 m^2/yr = 2.7 Tg/yr
```

### Sensitivity Check

- If reaction probability is 1% instead of 3%: 0.9 Tg/yr
- If reaction probability is 10%: 9 Tg/yr
- If effective hot-surface lifetime is 1 day instead of 2: halve everything
- If only 20% becomes airborne: 1.1 Tg/yr

**Central estimate: ~1-5 Tg/yr SiC from surface pyrolysis. Take 3 Tg/yr.**

### Verdict: UNDERMINES the monadnock model (moderately)

This is a significant SiC source. For context, the total volcanic particulate production is much larger (see Q4), so the SiC fraction from this source alone is small. But it is 10-100x larger than mantle-formed SiC and produces fine-grained material ideally suited for aeolian transport.

### Uncertainty: HIGH
The reaction probability on basalt at 1200K is the key unknown (spans 1-10%). The fraction that becomes airborne is also uncertain.

## Q3: LIGHTNING SiC

### Approach

Continuous lightning at the terminator drives plasma CVD in a SiH4/CH4/NH3/H2 gas mixture. The chemistry hub (§9) confirms that SiC films are among the known PECVD products of this gas mixture. But plasma CVD produces a wide range of products. What fraction is SiC?

### Lightning Energy Budget

From the spine: continuous lightning at terminator. Estimate total lightning power:

Earth's global lightning: ~10^9 flashes/yr, ~10^9 J/flash = ~10^18 J/yr ~ 30 GW

This planet's terminator is an unusually prolific lightning zone:
- Lower dielectric strength (8 bar but H2/NH3-rich gas has lower breakdown voltage per bar than N2/O2)
- Continuous triboelectric charging from unidirectional wind carrying volcanic particulate
- No diurnal cycle -- permanently active

Estimate: terminator lightning power ~ 10-100x Earth's global average per unit area, but over a smaller area (~10% of planetary surface). Total lightning power: ~10-100 GW, say ~30 GW = 10^18 J/yr.

### Product Partitioning

In plasma CVD of SiH4/CH4/NH3/H2 mixtures, the product distribution depends strongly on gas ratios and plasma conditions. Literature (industrial PECVD) for SiH4/CH4/NH3 mixtures gives approximate yields by mass:

| Product class | Approximate mass fraction of solid products |
|---|---|
| Amorphous SiCN films (mixed) | 30-50% |
| Amorphous Si3N4 | 10-20% |
| Amorphous SiC | 5-15% |
| Organosilicon polymers (silazanes, carbosilanes) | 20-40% |
| Amorphous Si | 5-10% |
| Other (HCN, aminosilanes -- volatile, not solid) | N/A (gas phase) |

The SiC fraction of solid products is ~5-15%. But the energy efficiency of converting electrical discharge energy into solid products is low: ~0.1-1% by mass relative to gas processed.

### Quantitative Estimate

Total energy: 10^18 J/yr in lightning.

Energy per unit SiC produced: Industrial PECVD uses ~10-100 MJ per kg of SiC film. Lightning is far less efficient (uncontrolled, short duration, most energy goes to heating/shockwave).

Effective energy cost in lightning: ~10^4 MJ/kg SiC (10,000x less efficient than industrial PECVD -- most energy is waste heat and shock).

```
SiC from lightning = 10^18 J/yr / (10^10 J/kg)
= 10^8 kg/yr
= 0.1 Tg/yr
```

But this is generous. Much of the SiC formed in a lightning channel is amorphous nanoscale material that may not survive as discrete SiC particles -- it recombines with other species, dissolves in ammonia rain, or remains as amorphous SiCN rather than crystalline SiC.

If we restrict to material that is identifiably SiC (crystalline or recognizably hard ceramic, not amorphous polymer): perhaps 10-30% of the above.

**Central estimate: ~0.01-0.1 Tg/yr crystalline/hard SiC from lightning. Take 0.03 Tg/yr.**

### Verdict: SUPPORTS the monadnock model

Lightning SiC is negligible compared to volcanic sources (Q1 + Q2). It is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller. Lightning is important as a Miller-Urey engine for complex organosilicon prebiotic chemistry, but not as a source of abrasive-grade SiC.

### Uncertainty: HIGH
The efficiency of crystalline SiC formation in natural lightning is effectively unconstrained by literature. The estimate could be off by an order of magnitude in either direction without changing the qualitative conclusion.

## Q4: TOTAL PRE-BIOTIC SiC FRACTION IN CONVEYOR PARTICULATE

### Total Volcanic Particulate Production

At 80-100 km^3/yr magma production, the fraction becoming atmospheric particulate includes:

1. **Explosive tephra**: at 8 bar, explosive volcanism is suppressed (confining pressure inhibits gas expansion). But Strombolian-style fountaining still occurs. Estimate ~5-10% of magma becomes fine ash (<100 um). At 90 km^3/yr and basalt density ~2900 kg/m^3:
   ```
   Tephra production = 90 km^3/yr * 2900 kg/m^3 * 0.07 = 1.8 x 10^13 kg/yr = 18,000 Tg/yr
   ```

2. **Lava weathering/spalling**: wind erosion of fresh lava surfaces produces fine particulate over time. Rough estimate: ~1% of annual lava production becomes fine particulate per century of exposure, but continuous resurfacing limits residence time. Comparable to or exceeding tephra over long timescales.

3. **Aeolian abrasion products**: self-grinding of silicate particulate in the conveyor produces additional fines.

**Total volcanic particulate entering the atmospheric conveyor: ~10,000-50,000 Tg/yr**

This is large but consistent with the "conveyor" model described in the spine -- continuous wind-driven transport of volcanic material.

However, the atmospheric conveyor is a CLOSED LOOP with a grain-size filter (the substellar chimney). Only material fine enough to be lofted by the chimney enters the global circulation. Coarser material accumulates in the deposition zone (20-40 deg day-ward).

The chimney's lofting cutoff depends on updraft velocity and air density. Estimate the maximum lofted grain size:

```
Terminal velocity v_t for a sphere in Stokes regime:
v_t = (rho_p - rho_air) * g * d^2 / (18 * mu)

For basalt (rho_p = 2900 kg/m^3), air at substellar (rho = 7.4 kg/m^3, mu ~ 2e-5 Pa*s):
g = 17.85 m/s^2
chimney updraft velocity: ~5-15 m/s (estimate for thermal chimney in 8 bar atmosphere)
```

Solving for d at v_t = 10 m/s:
```
d^2 = v_t * 18 * mu / ((rho_p - rho_air) * g)
= 10 * 18 * 2e-5 / ((2900 - 7.4) * 17.85)
= 3.6e-3 / 51,640
= 7.0 x 10^-8 m^2
d = 2.6 x 10^-4 m = 260 um
```

For SiC (rho_p = 3210 kg/m^3):
```
d = sqrt(10 * 18 * 2e-5 / ((3210 - 7.4) * 17.85))
= sqrt(3.6e-3 / 57,175) = sqrt(6.3e-8) = 250 um
```

So grains up to ~250-260 um can enter the global conveyor. Both mantle SiC crystals (10-500 um) and pyrolysis SiC flakes (mostly <100 um) fall within or near this range.

### SiC Budget Summary

| Source | SiC (Tg/yr) | Grain size | Enters conveyor? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mantle-formed (Q1) | 0.03% of 90 km^3/yr x 2900 kg/m^3 = **~80 Tg/yr** | 10-500 um | ~70% (fine fraction) |
| Surface pyrolysis (Q2) | **~3 Tg/yr** | <100 um (spalled films) | ~90% |
| Lightning (Q3) | **~0.03 Tg/yr** | <10 um (nanoparticulate) | ~100% |
| **Total SiC** | **~60 Tg/yr** | -- | -- |

Wait -- let me recalculate Q1 more carefully:

```
Mantle SiC: 0.03% of erupted magma mass
Erupted magma mass: 90 km^3/yr * 2.9 x 10^12 kg/km^3 = 2.6 x 10^14 kg/yr
Mantle SiC total: 0.0003 * 2.6e14 = 7.8 x 10^10 kg/yr = 78 Tg/yr
```

This is much larger than I initially noted in Q1. The total erupted mass is enormous. Even at 0.03% SiC content, the absolute mass is substantial.

But: most mantle SiC stays in the lava. Only crystals exposed at flow surfaces and liberated by erosion/fragmentation enter the atmospheric particulate. Fraction becoming airborne:
- SiC in tephra: ~7% of 78 Tg = ~5.5 Tg/yr (SiC fraction of tephra matches bulk magma fraction)
- SiC liberated from weathered lava surfaces: slow, maybe ~0.1%/yr of total emplaced SiC = ~0.08 Tg/yr

**Mantle SiC entering atmosphere: ~5-6 Tg/yr**

### Revised SiC Budget

| Source | SiC entering atmosphere (Tg/yr) |
|---|---|
| Mantle SiC (in tephra + weathered) | ~6 |
| Surface pyrolysis (spalled CVD film) | ~3 |
| Lightning | ~0.03 |
| **Total** | **~9 Tg/yr** |

### Total Conveyor Particulate for Comparison

The fine fraction of volcanic particulate entering the global conveyor (chimney-lofted):
```
Total tephra: ~18,000 Tg/yr
Fraction fine enough for chimney (<260 um): volcanic ash typically has ~30-50% in the <250 um range
Fine tephra = 18,000 * 0.4 = 7,200 Tg/yr
```

Plus aeolian fines from lava surface weathering: probably comparable over time, say another ~5,000 Tg/yr.

**Total conveyor particulate load: ~10,000-15,000 Tg/yr**

### SiC Mass Fraction in Conveyor

```
f_SiC = 9 Tg/yr / 12,000 Tg/yr = ~0.08% (range: 0.03-0.2%)
```

By volume (SiC: 3210 kg/m^3, basalt: 2900 kg/m^3):
```
f_vol = (f_mass / rho_SiC) / (f_mass/rho_SiC + (1-f_mass)/rho_basalt)
= (0.0008/3210) / (0.0008/3210 + 0.9992/2900)
= 2.5e-7 / 3.45e-4
~ 0.07% by volume
```

### Verdict: SUPPORTS the monadnock model

**SiC is ~0.08% of the conveyor particulate by mass.** The abrasive load is ~99.9% silicate, ~0.1% SiC. Peer-hardness abrasion is present but is a minor component of the total abrasive flux.

### Uncertainty: MODERATE-HIGH
The mantle SiC fraction (0.01-0.1%) and total particulate production (factor of ~2) are the main uncertainties. The SiC mass fraction could range from ~0.03% to ~0.3%.

---

## Q5: PEER-HARDNESS EROSION RATE

### Approach

We need two numbers:
1. **Erosion rate of SiC surface by the full abrasive mix** (99.9% silicate + 0.1% SiC)
2. **Erosion rate of silicate surface by the full abrasive mix** (same mix)

Then compare.

### Tribology of Hardness-Differential Abrasion

The Archard-Rabinowicz wear equation for abrasive wear:

```
V = K * F * L / H
```

where V = volume removed, K = dimensionless wear coefficient, F = normal force, L = sliding distance, H = hardness of the surface being abraded.

For aeolian erosion, the relevant parameter is the ratio of particle hardness (H_p) to surface hardness (H_s):

- **H_p > H_s**: Abrasion proceeds efficiently. K ~ 10^-3 to 10^-2 for typical aeolian erosion.
- **H_p < H_s**: Abrasion is negligible. The particle deforms/shatters on impact. K drops by 2-4 orders of magnitude (10^-6 to 10^-4). Literature consensus: when H_p/H_s < 0.8, wear rate drops essentially to zero for brittle materials.
- **H_p = H_s**: Peer-hardness abrasion. K ~ 10^-4 to 10^-3. Roughly 10x lower than H_p > H_s, because both particle and surface share the damage.

Hardness values:
- Basalt/silicate ash: Mohs 6-7, Vickers ~800-1200 HV
- SiC: Mohs 9.5, Vickers ~2500-3000 HV
- H_p/H_s for silicate-on-SiC: 800/2800 ~ 0.29 -- well below 0.8 threshold

### Erosion Rate of SiC Surface

**By silicate particles (99.9% of load):** Negligible. H_p/H_s = 0.29. Silicate particles shatter on impact with SiC. K ~ 0 (effectively zero for brittle-on-harder-brittle contact). Confirmed by industrial experience: alumina grinding wheels (Mohs 9) cannot efficiently grind SiC; only diamond or SiC abrasives are used for SiC finishing.

**By SiC particles (0.1% of load):** Peer-hardness abrasion proceeds. K ~ 5 x 10^-4 (literature value for SiC-on-SiC sliding abrasion, lower than typical 3-body abrasive wear because of mutual damage).

### Aeolian Erosion Model

Following Greeley & Iversen (1985) and subsequent work, aeolian erosion rate for a target surface:

```
E_dot = (q * K * rho_p * v^2) / (2 * H_s)
```

where:
- q = saltation/suspension mass flux (kg/m^2/s)
- K = wear coefficient
- rho_p = particle density
- v = impact velocity (related to wind speed; for suspended fines, v ~ v_wind)
- H_s = target surface hardness

But more useful is the mass-flux-based approach. The key input is the total aeolian mass flux at the terminator.

### Estimating Aeolian Mass Flux at Terminator

Total conveyor particulate: ~12,000 Tg/yr circulating globally.

The terminator is ~62,000 km of circumference, and wind crosses it over a band ~500-1000 km wide (where wind is ~8-10 m/s). Total cross-sectional area of the terminator wind corridor: ~62,000 km x 10 km height x some vertical distribution.

But it is simpler to estimate from concentration:

Total atmospheric dust loading: 12,000 Tg sustained in a circulation that takes ~30-55 days per circuit. Atmospheric volume in the conveyor: roughly half the atmosphere is actively in the loop at any time, ~2.6 x 10^19 m^3.

```
Mean dust concentration = 12,000 Tg / (30 days * ...)
```

Actually, let me approach this differently. The total mass flux of particulate past the terminator:

If 12,000 Tg/yr passes through the conveyor loop with a ~40 day circuit time, the instantaneous atmospheric particulate load is:

```
M_atm = 12,000 Tg * (40/365) = ~1,300 Tg in the atmosphere at any time
```

Atmospheric mass: 5.28 x 10^19 kg. Dust loading: 1.3 x 10^15 / 5.28 x 10^19 = ~25 ppm by mass. This seems low but the atmosphere is very massive.

For a column of air 10 km high at the terminator, with density 8.2 kg/m^3 at the surface (declining with scale height 5.5 km):
- Column mass per m^2: integral of rho*dz from 0 to inf = P/g = 8e5 Pa / 17.85 = 44,800 kg/m^2
- Dust in that column: 44,800 * 25e-6 = 1.1 kg/m^2 of column

Horizontal mass flux at 9.5 m/s wind through this column:

```
q_total = concentration * wind_speed * height_integral
```

Actually, the mass flux per unit width of terminator:
```
q = 1.1 kg/m^2 * 9.5 m/s = 10.5 kg/(m*s)
```

This is the horizontal flux -- the rate at which particulate passes any given point at the terminator, per meter of terminator width.

The erosion-relevant quantity is the vertical flux (impact rate on the ground surface), which is related to the settling velocity of the particles:

```
For d = 100 um basalt in 8.2 kg/m^3 air:
v_settle = (rho_p - rho_air) * g * d^2 / (18 * mu)
= (2900 - 8.2) * 17.85 * (10^-4)^2 / (18 * 2.5e-5)
= 2892 * 17.85 * 10^-8 / (4.5e-4)
= 5.16e-4 / 4.5e-4
= 1.15 m/s
```

Hmm, that's high. Let me check -- at this Re, we may be out of Stokes regime.

```
Re_p = rho_air * v * d / mu = 8.2 * 1.15 * 10^-4 / 2.5e-5 = 37.7
```

Re > 1, so Stokes is not valid. Using Schiller-Naumann correction:

```
C_D = 24/Re * (1 + 0.15 * Re^0.687)
= 24/37.7 * (1 + 0.15 * 37.7^0.687)
= 0.637 * (1 + 0.15 * 12.4)
= 0.637 * 2.86
= 1.82
```

```
v_settle = sqrt(4 * d * (rho_p - rho_air) * g / (3 * C_D * rho_air))
= sqrt(4 * 10^-4 * 2892 * 17.85 / (3 * 1.82 * 8.2))
= sqrt(20.65 / 44.77)
= sqrt(0.461)
= 0.68 m/s
```

For 100 um grains, settling velocity ~ 0.7 m/s. These are in the saltation/suspension regime -- kept aloft by turbulence but frequently impacting the surface.

For the aeolian impact flux on a surface, use the "mass bombardment rate":

```
Impact flux ~ C_dust * v_impact
```

where C_dust is the near-surface dust concentration (kg/m^3) and v_impact combines settling velocity and wind-driven lateral impact:

Near-surface concentration (saltation layer, lowest ~1 m):
- Assume ~10x the column-average concentration (particles concentrate near ground in saltation): C_surface ~ 10 * 25e-6 * 8.2 kg/m^3 = 2.1 x 10^-3 kg/m^3

Impact velocity for saltation: v_impact ~ 0.1-0.3 * v_wind for oblique impacts = ~1-3 m/s

```
Impact flux = 2.1e-3 kg/m^3 * 2 m/s = 4.2 x 10^-3 kg/(m^2*s)
```

### Erosion Rate Calculation

**Silicate surface under full abrasive load:**

All impacts contribute (silicate-on-silicate, SiC-on-silicate both cause wear):

```
K_eff = K_sil-on-sil * f_sil + K_SiC-on-sil * f_SiC
= 5e-3 * 0.999 + 10e-3 * 0.001
= 5.0e-3 (SiC contribution is negligible)
```

```
E_dot (volume) = K_eff * F_impact / H_surface
```

Using energy-based erosion model:
```
E_dot = K_eff * impact_flux * v_impact^2 / (2 * H_surface)
= 5e-3 * 4.2e-3 * 4 / (2 * 10^9)     [H in Pa; basalt ~1 GPa Vickers]
= 5e-3 * 4.2e-3 * 4 / 2e9
= 4.2e-14 m^3/(m^2*s)
= 4.2e-14 m/s = 1.3 x 10^-6 m/yr = 1.3 um/yr = 1,300 mm/Myr
```

This is very high -- in line with extreme aeolian erosion environments. Let me sanity-check against Earth values.

Earth desert aeolian erosion: ~1-100 um/yr for soft rock, ~0.1-10 um/yr for hard rock. Our value is ~1.3 um/yr for basalt. But this planet has ~10x the dynamic pressure, ~10x the dust loading (continuous volcanic source), and the wind never stops. So ~10-100x Earth rates seems right. 1.3 um/yr for basalt is within the plausible range.

**SiC surface under full abrasive load:**

Only SiC particles contribute (0.1% of load):

```
K_SiC-on-SiC = 5e-4 (peer-hardness, lower K)
Effective impact flux from SiC particles only: 4.2e-3 * 0.001 = 4.2e-6 kg/(m^2*s)
```

```
E_dot(SiC surface) = K_SiC-on-SiC * SiC_impact_flux * v_impact^2 / (2 * H_SiC)
= 5e-4 * 4.2e-6 * 4 / (2 * 2.8e10)    [H_SiC ~ 28 GPa Vickers]
= 8.4e-9 / 5.6e10
= 1.5e-19 m/s
```

Wait, that doesn't seem right dimensionally. Let me use a cleaner approach.

### Revised Erosion Model (Dimensional)

Using the standard aeolian erosion formulation (after Sklar & Dietrich 2004, adapted):

```
Erosion rate (m/s) = q_s * (v_i^2) / (2 * epsilon_v * sigma_T)
```

where:
- q_s = mass impact flux per unit area (kg/m^2/s)
- v_i = impact velocity (m/s)
- epsilon_v = energy required to remove unit volume (J/m^3) ~ k_v * H (hardness)
- sigma_T = tensile strength of target

This gets complicated. Let me use a simpler, well-calibrated approach.

### Simplified Approach: Relative Wear Rates

From tribology literature on abrasive wear:

**When particle is harder than surface (H_p/H_s > 1.2):**
```
Wear rate ~ K_hard * (load) * (distance) / H_s
K_hard ~ 10^-3 to 10^-2
```

**When particle hardness equals surface (peer-hardness):**
```
Wear rate ~ K_peer * (load) * (distance) / H_s
K_peer ~ 10^-4 to 5*10^-4
```

**When particle is softer than surface (H_p/H_s < 0.8):**
```
Wear rate ~ 0 (for brittle ceramics; particle shatters)
```

The ratio of SiC monadnock erosion to silicate terrain erosion:

```
E_SiC / E_silicate = [K_peer * f_SiC * H_silicate] / [K_hard * f_eff * H_SiC]
```

where f_eff is the effective fraction of particles that can erode the silicate surface (all of them -- both silicate and SiC particles erode silicate):

```
E_SiC / E_silicate = [5e-4 * 0.001 * 1e9] / [5e-3 * 1.0 * 28e9]
= [5e-4] / [1.4e8]
= 5e2 / 1.4e8
= 3.6e-6
```

Hmm, let me redo this ratio more carefully.

The erosion rate of each surface is proportional to:
```
E ~ Sum over particle types: [K_i * f_i * impact_energy] / H_surface
```

For **silicate bedrock** (H = 1 GPa):
```
E_sil ~ [K_sil-sil * 0.999 + K_SiC-sil * 0.001] * q * v^2 / (2 * H_sil)
      ~ [5e-3 * 0.999 + 1e-2 * 0.001] * q * v^2 / (2 * 1e9)
      ~ [5.0e-3] * q * v^2 / (2e9)
```

(Using K = 1e-2 for harder-on-softer because SiC is much harder than silicate.)

For **SiC outcrop** (H = 28 GPa):
```
E_SiC ~ [K_sil-SiC * 0.999 + K_SiC-SiC * 0.001] * q * v^2 / (2 * H_SiC)
      ~ [0 * 0.999 + 3e-4 * 0.001] * q * v^2 / (2 * 28e9)
      ~ [3e-7] * q * v^2 / (5.6e10)
```

The ratio:
```
E_SiC / E_sil = [3e-7 / 5.6e10] / [5e-3 / 2e9]
              = [5.4e-18] / [2.5e-12]
              = 2.1e-6
```

**The differential erosion ratio is approximately 1 : 500,000.**

This means SiC erodes approximately 500,000 times slower than the surrounding silicate terrain.

But let me double-check by computing absolute rates.

### Absolute Erosion Rates

**Silicate bedrock erosion rate:**

Using calibrated aeolian erosion data. On Earth, desert erosion of granite (Mohs ~6-7) at ~10 m/s winds in 1.2 kg/m^3 air: ~1-10 um/yr.

Scaling to this planet:
- Dynamic pressure ratio: (0.5 * 8.2 * 9.5^2) / (0.5 * 1.2 * 10^2) = 370/60 = 6.2x
- Particulate loading: continuous volcanic source vs. finite desert supply. At least 10x higher loading.
- Wind never stops: 24/7/365 vs. intermittent on Earth. ~3x effective time increase.
- Rock hardness: comparable (basalt vs. granite)

Scaling factor: 6.2 * 10 * 3 ~ **190x**

Earth granite erosion ~3 um/yr --> this planet's silicate erosion: **~570 um/yr ~ 600 um/yr**

Or equivalently: **~600 mm/Myr** for silicate bedrock at the terminator.

Cross-check: this implies ~600 m of silicate erosion per Myr. Over the planet's ~7 Gyr history, that's 4,200 km of erosion. Obviously, volcanic resurfacing replenishes. At the terminator (no volcanism), ancient relief would be obliterated in ~10-50 Myr depending on original height. This is consistent with the spine's statement that the terminator is a "flat peneplain" and that "billions of years of wind + ammonia erosion" produced it.

**SiC outcrop erosion rate:**

```
E_SiC = E_sil * 2.1e-6 = 600 um/yr * 2.1e-6 = 1.3 x 10^-3 um/yr = 1.3 nm/yr
```

Equivalently: **1.3 um/Myr** or **1.3 mm per billion years**.

### Summary Table

| Surface | Erosion rate (mm/Myr) | Erosion rate (m/Myr) |
|---|---|---|
| Silicate bedrock | ~600,000 | ~600 |
| SiC monadnock | ~0.0013 | ~1.3 x 10^-6 |
| **Ratio (silicate : SiC)** | **~500,000,000 : 1** | -- |

Wait -- this ratio seems too extreme. Let me reconsider.

The issue is that I set K = 0 for silicate-on-SiC. In reality, even softer particles cause some wear through:
- Fatigue wear (repeated sub-threshold impacts cause micro-fracture over millions of cycles)
- Chemical-mechanical effects (silicate dust + ammonia could etch SiC at defects)
- Thermal cycling stress (240K with occasional volcanic heating events)

These mechanisms typically contribute K ~ 10^-6 to 10^-5 even when H_p/H_s < 0.8.

### Revised with fatigue and chemical wear

Adding sub-threshold mechanisms for silicate-on-SiC:

```
K_sil-SiC (fatigue) ~ 10^-6
```

Revised SiC erosion:
```
E_SiC ~ [1e-6 * 0.999 + 3e-4 * 0.001] * q * v^2 / (2 * 28e9)
      ~ [1e-6 + 3e-7] * q * v^2 / (5.6e10)
      ~ [1.3e-6] * q * v^2 / (5.6e10)
```

Revised ratio:
```
E_SiC / E_sil = [1.3e-6 / 5.6e10] / [5e-3 / 2e9]
              = [2.3e-17] / [2.5e-12]
              = 9.3e-6
```

Revised SiC erosion rate: 600 mm/Myr * 9.3e-6 = **5.6 x 10^-3 mm/Myr ~ 0.006 mm/Myr = 6 um/Myr**

This is more physical. The fatigue term (silicate repeatedly hitting SiC over geological time) dominates over peer-hardness SiC-on-SiC abrasion by about 4:1.

### Revised Summary

| Surface | Erosion rate (mm/Myr) | Primary mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Silicate bedrock | ~600 | Direct abrasion by silicate + SiC |
| SiC monadnock | ~0.006 | Fatigue (silicate) + peer-hardness (SiC) |
| **Differential ratio** | **~100,000 : 1** | -- |

### Verdict: STRONGLY SUPPORTS the monadnock model

Even including peer-hardness SiC abrasion AND fatigue wear from silicate impacts, the SiC monadnock erodes ~100,000x slower than surrounding silicate terrain. The SiC fraction in the conveyor (~0.1%) is far too small to materially threaten the monadnock on genesis timescales.

### Uncertainty: MODERATE
The fatigue wear coefficient (K ~ 10^-6) for silicate-on-SiC under continuous aeolian bombardment over Myr timescales is the least constrained parameter. It could plausibly range from 10^-7 (very clean SiC, no defects) to 10^-5 (N-doped SiC with biological inclusions, grain boundaries). This shifts the differential ratio from ~10^6 to ~10^4. Even at the pessimistic end, the monadnock far outlasts silicate terrain.

## Q6: MONADNOCK SURVIVAL TIMESCALE

### Monadnock Survival at 0.006 mm/Myr Erosion

For a monadnock maintaining >10 m of relief:

**Time for monadnock to erode from 100 m to 10 m relief** (assuming flat-topped mesa geometry where only the top surface erodes):

```
t = 90 m / 0.006 mm/Myr = 90,000 / 0.006 Myr = 15,000,000 Myr = 15 Gyr
```

This exceeds the age of the universe. The monadnock is effectively **indestructible** on any relevant timescale.

Even if we use a 10x pessimistic erosion rate (0.06 mm/Myr, fatigue K = 10^-5):

```
t = 90 m / 0.06 mm/Myr = 1,500,000 Myr = 1.5 Gyr
```

Still far exceeds the genesis timescale.

But: the monadnock does not erode only from the top. Flanks, wind-scour at the base, and ammonia chemical attack all contribute.

### Flank Erosion and Undercutting

Wind erosion at the monadnock base produces undercuts (wind speed is highest at constrictions). If flank erosion is ~10x faster than top erosion due to flow acceleration:

```
Flank erosion: ~0.06 mm/Myr (optimistic) to ~0.6 mm/Myr (pessimistic)
```

Time to undercut a 100 m wide base by 10 m:
```
t = 10,000 mm / 0.6 mm/Myr = 16,700 Myr ~ 17 Gyr (pessimistic)
```

Still effectively permanent.

### Ammonia Chemical Attack

NH3 does not attack SiC (Chemistry Hub §10.1: "ammonia does not attack Si-Si bonds" and SiC is even more inert). However, N-doped SiC from biological origin may have grain boundaries, pores, and inclusions that are more vulnerable.

Dissolution rate of SiC in liquid NH3 at 240K: essentially zero. SiC is one of the most chemically resistant materials known. It resists attack by all common acids and bases except molten KOH and hot H3PO4. Liquid ammonia at 240K is orders of magnitude less aggressive.

Chemical erosion rate: **negligible** (~0.001 um/Myr estimated upper bound for defect-selective dissolution).

### Comparison to Genesis Timescale

| Timescale | Duration |
|---|---|
| Pool genesis (abiogenesis) | ~10^5 - 10^6 yr (established constraint) |
| SiC monadnock half-life (pessimistic) | ~10^9 yr (1 Gyr) |
| SiC monadnock half-life (central) | ~10^10 yr (10 Gyr) |
| Silicate terrain erasure | ~10^5 yr for 60 m relief; ~10^6 yr for 600 m |
| Time for surrounding peneplain formation | ~10-50 Myr to remove any natural hill |

**The monadnock outlasts the genesis timescale by 3-4 orders of magnitude.** Even the most pessimistic erosion estimate gives the monadnock ~1000x longer life than needed.

### Deep-Rock Replenishment

The analysis above assumes no replenishment. But the deep-rock colony continues depositing SiC from below. This is a living system -- metabolic waste (SiC) accumulates at the surface as new lattice.

Deep-rock growth rate is unknown but bounded:
- Upper bound: biological SiC deposition limited by geothermal SiH4 flux through the fracture network
- Lower bound: geological-pace waste accumulation, perhaps ~0.001-0.01 mm/yr (1-10 um/yr)

Even at the lower bound (0.001 mm/yr = 1000 mm/Myr), the deep-rock SiC deposition rate **exceeds the surface erosion rate by 5-6 orders of magnitude**:

```
Deposition: ~1000 mm/Myr (lower bound)
Erosion: ~0.006 mm/Myr (central estimate)
Net: +999.994 mm/Myr (net GROWTH)
```

The monadnock is actively growing, not shrinking. Surface erosion is irrelevant compared to biological accretion from below.

### Verdict: STRONGLY SUPPORTS the monadnock model

The monadnock is not merely surviving -- it is growing through geological time. Volcanic SiC in the abrasive load is a perturbation too small to matter. The proto-tower/monadnock provides stable, long-lived shelter for pool genesis with massive margins.

### Uncertainty: LOW for the survival question
The conclusion is robust across the full uncertainty range of every parameter. The margins are so large (3-6 orders of magnitude depending on what you compare) that no reasonable parameter adjustment can flip the verdict.

---

## SYNTHESIS

### OVERALL VERDICT: The monadnock model is ROBUST.

Pre-biotic volcanic SiC production is real and quantifiable (~9 Tg/yr entering the atmospheric conveyor), but it constitutes only ~0.08% of the total particulate load by mass. The resulting peer-hardness erosion of the SiC monadnock is negligible (~0.006 mm/Myr central estimate), yielding a monadnock survival timescale of >1 Gyr -- far exceeding the ~10^5-10^6 yr genesis requirement.

The monadnock is not passively enduring erosion; it is actively growing from below via deep-rock SiC deposition. Even the most conservative biological accretion rate exceeds surface erosion by 5+ orders of magnitude.

The original concern -- that volcanic SiC would create peer-hardness abrasion threatening the monadnock -- is quantitatively unfounded. The SiC fraction of the abrasive load is too small (~0.1%), the hardness advantage of SiC over silicate is too large (Mohs 9.5 vs 6-7), and the deep-rock replenishment is too fast.

### KEY SENSITIVITY: SiC Mass Fraction in Conveyor Particulate

If the SiC fraction were ~10% instead of ~0.1%, peer-hardness erosion would increase by ~100x to ~0.6 mm/Myr. This would shorten monadnock life to ~150 Myr (still adequate for genesis but no longer negligible). A ~10% SiC fraction would require either:
- Mantle SiC at ~3% of erupted magma (implausibly high -- would require the erupted magma to be dominated by metallic Si alloy, which contradicts silicate magma petrography), OR
- Surface pyrolysis SiC production ~1000x higher (would require ~100% reaction probability and no pyrolysis SiC staying on the surface -- physically impossible)

No plausible parameter combination reaches 10% SiC in the conveyor. The sensitivity exists in principle but is not reachable in practice.

The parameter that most affects the absolute erosion rate of the monadnock is the **fatigue wear coefficient for silicate-on-SiC** (K_fatigue). This is poorly constrained by experiment for geological timescales. But even its full uncertainty range (10^-7 to 10^-5) only shifts the differential erosion ratio from ~10^6 to ~10^4, both of which are overwhelmingly favorable for monadnock survival.

### DIFFERENTIAL EROSION RATIO

```
Silicate terrain erosion : SiC monadnock erosion = 100,000 : 1
(range: 10,000 : 1 to 1,000,000 : 1 depending on fatigue coefficient)
```

This means: in the time the monadnock loses 1 mm, the surrounding silicate terrain loses 100 meters. The monadnock is, for all practical purposes on genesis timescales, permanent.

### IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CANON

1. **No revision needed.** The monadnock model (Pool Genesis Hub §2.5, Geology Hub §8) is quantitatively sound. Proto-tower SiC mountains at the terminator survive pre-biotic erosion with massive margins.

2. **SiC polish effect is real but post-biotic.** The spine's description of "SiC-polished bedrock" on the dark side requires biological SiC (dead-bug plume). Pre-biotic SiC from volcanic sources alone is insufficient to produce the mirror-polish effect at ~0.1% of the conveyor load. The pre-biotic conveyor is ~99.9% silicate, producing normal (not mirror) erosion. The polishing effect described in the spine is a post-biotic phenomenon -- which is already implied by its attribution to the "dead-bug plume."

3. **The one-way door holds.** Once biology begins feeding SiC into the conveyor (dead-bug plume), the SiC fraction jumps dramatically. If biogenic SiC eventually dominates the conveyor (plausible -- every tower sheds SiC continuously), then the differential erosion ratio drops from 100,000:1 toward 1:1, and natural topography erodes much faster relative to the (now biologically maintained) SiC towers. This confirms the spine's statement that the ecosystem "erased the genesis conditions" by feeding SiC into the aeolian loop.

4. **Volcanic SiC has a separate interesting role.** While negligible as an erosion threat to the monadnock, pre-biotic volcanic SiC (~9 Tg/yr) is a source of hard abrasive that would polish the dark-side peneplain to some degree even before biology exists. Pre-biotic dark-side surfaces would be smooth but not mirror-polished. The transition from smooth-to-mirror is a marker of the biosphere's onset -- potentially detectable in the geological record.
