| Ammonia seas (nightside) | Shallow seas in lowest nightside basins. 50–200 m depth (model range, narrative knob). Fed by the ~5–20% of volcanic NH₃ that crosses the terminator mound crest (preferentially via polar gateway where mound is thin). NOT hemisphere-spanning. Most nightside terrain is dry. Depth uniform across nightside basins (hydrostatic equilibrium — rotational/tidal bulges don't create systematic depth variation). | Liquid, stable (cold, no evaporation). |
| Hydrocarbon lakes | Deep dark side. Ethane/propane. | ~450–550 kg/m³ |

## GEOLOGY

**✓** Stagnant lid. No plate tectonics, no subduction. Heat escapes via mantle plumes.

**✓** Hemispheric asymmetry: day-side lid thinner/warmer, plumes breach preferentially. Dark-side lid thick/cold/stable.

| Zone | Description |
|---|---|
| Day side | Volcanically active. 10–30 provinces simultaneously. ~100 Myr resurfacing. Continuous, not episodic. Source of SiH₄ + H₂O outgassing. |
| Dark side | Geologically quiescent. Ancient stable crust. Minimal volcanism. |
| Terminator | Lithospheric flexure zone. Chronic cracking/faulting. Primary fracture networks. |
| Fracture networks | Discontinuous. Each isolated system hosts independent deep-rock system. |
| Sea basins | Volcanic: calderas, rift basins, terminator flexure depressions. |
| Metal ores | Native metals (reducing atm = no oxidation). Concentrated by magmatic differentiation + NH₃ hydrothermal. Day-side volcanic provinces. |
| Fissile materials | U/Th present (~4.2× Earth inventory). Magmatic + NH₃-hydrothermal concentration. |
| Atm. silane budget | Volcanic SiH₄ ~1000 Tg/yr at peak, currently declining. One-way cycle (no subduction). Crisis = production below consumption. |

**✓** Mechanical karst: ammonia + SiC grit percolating through deep-rock fracture networks erodes silicate fracture walls. Tower defense: ammonia intrusion detected via root conductivity changes → Healer sealing. Response time critical — small crack seals easily, established flow channel is a losing battle. Underground SiCN armoring doubles as grounding capacity. Sinkhole formation under towers with deferred maintenance = irreversible foundation failure. See Tower Morphology Hub §10.6, Planetary Geology Hub.

**✓** Volcanic regime: continuous day-side plume volcanism (~80–100 km³/yr magma, 10–30 provinces simultaneously). No episodic global lid overturn — hemispheric asymmetry is a permanent pressure-release valve.

**✓** Day-side resurfacing interval: ~100 Myr. Dark-side plume breakthrough: rare (~500 Myr–1 Gyr), localized, not global overturn.

**✓** Volcanism is a chemical hazard, not thermal. Stellar heating is ~1600× internal heat. No volcanic winters. All volcanic threats are atmospheric chemistry.

**✓** SiH₄ formed by pressure-driven equilibrium at depth (Si + 2H₂ → SiH₄, P(SiH₄) ∝ P(H₂)², kinetically trapped during ascent). Temperature helps (endothermic, van 't Hoff) but pressure dominates.

**✓** Silicon cycle is one-way: SiH₄ → biological Si → SiC/SiO₂ surface deposits (permanent). No subduction = no recycling to mantle. Only fresh mantle processing regenerates SiH₄.

## WIND

| Zone | Speed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anti-stellar pole | ~0 m/s | Stagnation point. Calmest. Paired anticyclonic divergence. |
| Dark side | 2–8 m/s | Accelerating toward terminator. S-shaped paths (Coriolis). |
| Peak (~30–40° from anti-stellar) | ~10 m/s | Maximum surface wind |
| Terminator | ~9.5 m/s sustained | Unidirectional (night→day). ~15° Coriolis deflection at mid-latitudes. |
| Day side (within 20–30°) | 5–8 m/s | Accelerating toward substellar (convergent geometry) |
| Day side (within 40–50°) | 2–4 m/s | Accelerating |
| Substellar | ~17 m/s peak at θ≈12° | Thermal chimney. Paired cyclonic Rossby gyres at mid-latitudes. |

**✓** Velocity field (axisymmetric, ignoring vortices): v(θ) = v_term × (sin θ)^(−1/4), where θ = angular distance from substellar point. Valid θ ≈ 12° to 90°. Wind accelerates toward substellar point due to spherical convergence. See `super_earth_analysis (1).md` §2.4 for full vector field.

**✓** Coriolis: significant at planetary scale. Ro ≈ 0.17 at terminator wind speeds (9.5 m/s, f = 5.7×10⁻⁶ at 45°, L = R_planet). S-shaped surface flow paths. ~15° deflection at mid-latitude terminator. Zero at equator. Paired cyclonic gyres flank the substellar point; paired anticyclonic features at anti-stellar. Standing Rossby wave patterns on dark side create permanent convergence/divergence zones. No significant equatorial superrotation (18-day period past transition).

**✓** Latitude-dependent terminator: Ro ranges from ∞ at equatorial terminator (f = 0, flow purely radial) to ~0.12 at polar terminator (strongly geostrophic, flow along terminator). Consequences: (1) rain concentrated at equatorial terminator (superstream converges head-on), polar terminator receives less direct precipitation; (2) ammonia mound thick at equatorial terminator (radial flow piles up), thin or absent at polar terminator (flow deflected along terminator instead of piling up); (3) polar gateway — ammonia enters nightside preferentially through polar terminator where mound is thin. Mound height is latitude-dependent; nightside ocean depth is NOT (liquid finds common level). Delivery pathway ≠ steady-state depth. Equatorial terminator = intense storm front; polar terminator = drier, calmer, walkable. Two distinct ecological zones.

**✓** Equatorial superrotation: negligible or absent. 18-day rotation period is past the ~12-day transition to the non-superrotating regime (Carone et al. 2015). No significant hotspot offset, no E-W terminator asymmetry. The terminator is azimuthally symmetric at leading order; latitude gradient from Coriolis is the only significant symmetry-breaker. (Earlier estimate of 5–10° offset was based on an erroneous 9-day rotation period.)

**✓** No precession: tidally locked at 0.12 AU, obliquity damped to zero, orbit circularized. Pole-to-pole symmetry broken only by Coriolis (latitude-dependent f). No seasonal variation.

**✓** Substellar region is DRY. Thermal chimney lifts hot ammonia-vapor-laden air aloft. Rain falls where upper-level outflow cools through dew point (~240K) — at and night-ward of the terminator. Day side is the evaporator, not the condenser.

**✓** Day-side ammonia access: ~80–95% of rainfall lands on the day-side slope of the terminator mound (§3.6.2). Liquid ammonia flows day-ward as ephemeral rivers/deltas until evaporating at the ~240K boundary. Daysiders near the terminator have direct access to ammonia runoff without entering tower territory. Daysider raids on terminator settlements are for POWER (charge) and METALS (tower-delivered catalytic metals), not for ammonia. SiH₄ is atmospheric (everywhere). Ammonia is rain-delivered on the day-side mound face.

**✓** No terminator convergence updraft. Surface flow is unidirectional (night→day) at all points. Shear layer between surface katabatic flow and upper-level return flow (opposite directions) produces Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence but no organized uplift.

**✓** Terminator = accretional sediment wedge, NOT erosional peneplain. Tower breakwater arrays + SiC grass lattice intercept grit-laden ammonia sheet flow → sediment accumulates, surface rises over geological time. Towers grow upward through accumulating sediment. Asymmetric cross-section: gentle dark-side slope (wet, actively accumulating), flat top (tower forest, grass-stabilized), steep day-side face (dry, wind-eroded at ~240K evaporation boundary). Kill the towers → grass dies → entire wedge erodes away.

**✓** SiC grass: continuous self-growing SiC lattice field covering the terminator. Sparse surface blades (slow wind at interface, harvest energy) + dense buried root network (structural integrity, accumulated at every past surface level). Connected to tower root network electrically. Prevents valley formation by disrupting flow everywhere. Grows upward through accumulating sediment (like Earth grass). Surface root highways = raised travel corridors (FPGA-structured, maintained, monitored — distinct from grass).

**✓** Grass energy mechanism: PIEZOELECTRIC wind harvesting. SiC is natively piezoelectric (3C zinc blende, d₁₄ ≈ 1–3 pC/N). Blades vibrate in wind → charge generated automatically → flows through conductive lattice to tower root network. Anti-erosion function IS the energy-harvesting function (same physical process: removing kinetic energy from wind). No biology required. Inert dead SiC does this. Grass is self-powering, not a net cost to tower. Secondary: distributed lightning collection (conductive grass field = planet-scale lightning rod). NOT photovoltaic (SiC bandgap 2.36+ eV too wide for M-dwarf peak at 1.46 eV / 850 nm — SiC is transparent to the star).

**✓** Grass is informationally DEAD. Bare SiC lattice — no FPGA structure, no biofilm, no signal processing. Tower receives charge from grass but has no awareness of or control over what happens on it. Electrically conductive, informationally blind. Sharp boundary: surface root highways = FPGA, maintained, signal-carrying. Grass = dumb conductor.

**✓** Grass-field ecosystem: independent of tower ecology. Any organism making Schottky contact with grass lattice draws charge — no tower authentication, no guild membership, no chelation toll. Open commons. Piezo trickle = subsistence (keeps organisms alive, not thriving). Tower grid = banquet. Two separate ecologies with minimal interaction: tower middle-kingdom (authenticated, managed, high-energy) vs grass-field organisms (unauthenticated, unmanaged, low-energy). Grass field is the uninfluenced zone — keyless amorphs on grass are outside tower behavioral shaping.

**✓** Piezoelectric SiC as universal energy mechanism: not just grass. Any SiC-bearing organism vibrating in wind harvests piezo charge — MEMS dorsal shells (~70 Hz), balloon fauna reef structures, free-living middle kingdom armor plates. Tower is the most efficient concentrator (cathedral-scale lattice + lightning). Atmospheric SiH₄ = chemical feedstock; wind-on-SiC = power. Non-tower food chain has always had this foundation.

**✓** Ammonia sheet flow hydrology (without towers): no ammonia ocean. Dark side below 240K dew point → supersaturated atmosphere → continuous condensation. On a flat surface: thin wind-driven sheet flow (~10 cm at terminator) flowing day-ward. Laminar, gentle, negligible erosive power on flat peneplain. Towers' own turbulence creates the erosion problem (self-inflicted). Sheet flow is a grit DELIVERY mechanism, not an erosion mechanism.

**✓** Rain belt is a BUFFER, not a wall. Ammonia rain = phase change (air→liquid→air). Particulate enters rain, transits through terminator sediment body in liquid flow, ammonia evaporates at day-side ~240K boundary, dried particulate re-enters atmospheric wind conveyor. Only permanent sinks: breakwater/grass mounds, sea beds, biological incorporation. Rain does not permanently remove anything from the atmospheric conveyor.

**✓** Effective hydrological cycle is TERMINATOR-TO-SUBSTELLAR, not planet-wide. The superstream (warm, NH₃-laden, from dayside) enters the condensation zone well dayside of the mound crest. Most rainfall (~80–95%) lands on the dayside slope, evaporates, and recycles within the dayside atmosphere. Only ~5–20% of volcanic NH₃ crosses the terminator mound to reach the nightside as liquid. Nightside is ammonia-starved. Nightside tower growth is starved of atmospheric particulate (no rain, no wind-borne sediment delivery). Megaflood scenario is dead — the mound holds by 1–3 km of headroom over the shallow nightside sea.

**✓** Coupled dual-fluid erosion: in valleys between tower mounds, wind AND ammonia runoff channel together and reinforce each other. Breakwaters (cm-scale) slow liquid but don't affect wind. Wind keeps carving. Grass lattice prevents valley formation by disrupting both fluids across entire surface.

**✓** Deposition zone 20–40° day-ward. Deep sediment (km). Wind-transported mineral + volcanic ash.

## SURFACE GEOMORPHOLOGY

**✓** Atmospheric particulate conveyor: closed loop. Day-side volcanism → surface winds carry particulate to substellar chimney → chimney lofts fines into superstream → superstream carries to anti-stellar downdraft (velocity increases toward anti-stellar via spherical convergence — anything carried past the terminator goes the full distance) → deposition → katabatic surface winds re-entrain and carry back toward terminator/day side. Chimney acts as grain-size filter: only material light enough to be lofted enters the loop. Katabatic wind can re-entrain everything the chimney admitted. No net accumulation on the dark side (exception: anti-stellar stagnation cap — katabatic wind starts at ~0 m/s, local accumulation of finest fraction possible; minor, self-limiting, not geologically significant).

**✓** Dark-side peneplain: SiC-polished bedrock. Pre-biotic volcanic SiC (~9 Tg/yr, ~0.08% of conveyor particulate) smooths silicate terrain at ~600 mm/Myr before biology exists — smooth but not polished. Dead-bug plume later adds massive biological SiC, producing the mirror-polish (geological marker of biosphere onset). Dead-bug plume feeds SiC particulate (Mohs 9.5) into the atmospheric conveyor. SiC abrading silicate bedrock (Mohs 6-7) over billions of years produces mirror-smooth surface. No constructive geology (no volcanism, no tectonics) to rebuild. Two distinct laminar/turbulent regimes: (1) free-stream flow IS laminar (stably stratified atmosphere, no convection, no weather systems, no turbulence sources); (2) surface boundary layer is aerodynamically smooth turbulent (Re ~10¹², but surface roughness < viscous sublayer ~50 μm — no roughness-driven eddies). Both regimes → same consequence: only towers generate significant turbulence at any scale. Deep dark side is polished bedrock plain to the horizon.

**✓** Day-side geomorphology: active volcanic terrain. Continuous plume volcanism builds shield volcanoes and flood basalt provinces. Wind erosion sculpts but cannot overcome construction rate near substellar. Gradient from volcanic construction-dominated (substellar) to erosion-dominated (toward terminator). Yardangs, ventifacts, streamlined ridges oriented radially toward substellar.

**✓** Ammonia seas are tower-dependent features (modern). Towers are the only self-repairing roughness element on the planet. Tower breaks aerodynamically smooth boundary layer → turbulence → scour basins in accumulated sediment → topographic complexity that holds liquid ammonia. Basin maintenance: grass/breakwater field intercepts grit-laden sheet flow UPSTREAM of basin (pre-filters liquid before it reaches scour depression). Kill the tower → grass dies → basin fills with aeolian sediment → surface reclaims it. Without towers, ammonia seas cannot persist — any depression is a sediment trap (everything sinks in ammonia, atmospheric fallout fills it).

**✓** Shore deposition zones: where katabatic wind meets ammonia surface, waves create roughness, boundary layer trips to turbulent, wind carrying capacity drops, particulate falls out. Shorelines are the ONE place on the dark side where material accumulates. SiC grit, volcanic fines, dead-bug plume debris (catalytic metals, library fragments, SiC plates). Shore = nutrient delivery system connecting atmospheric and marine cycles. Primary reason shore/intertidal is the richest marine zone.

**✓** Genesis environment: proto-tower-base ammonia pools at the terminator. Proto-tower = deep-rock system's surface SiC outcrop (Mohs 9.5, differential erosion ratio ~100,000:1 vs silicate terrain). Survives pre-biotic erosion: volcanic SiC is only ~0.08% of conveyor particulate; silicate abrasive (Mohs 6-7) cannot scratch SiC. Pre-biotic silicate terrain erodes at ~600 mm/Myr; monadnock erosion ~0.006 mm/Myr.

**✓** Proto-tower seven force multipliers (for tower-adjacent pools): (1) geothermal SiH₄ venting through fractures (bypasses atmospheric dissolution bottleneck), (2) metal-enriched fracture fluids (all four biometals — Ni, Fe, Co, Ti — via hydrothermal circulation), (3) lightning rod effect (tallest object concentrates Miller-Urey products into adjacent pools), (4) warm fluids (+5–20K geothermal), (5) N-doped SiC semiconductor substrate (catalytic surfaces, electrochemical gradients), (6) flow-through hydrology (drainage maintains <1 ppm H₂O, delivers fresh inputs, creates chemical gradients), (7) micro-pool multiplication (rough lattice topography → many parallel experiments per monadnock). **⚠ NOTE:** Fracture-connected pools fill too fast for genesis (geyser-cone construction fills pools in years to decades; genesis requires My-scale). Force multipliers enhance tower construction and indirectly benefit neighboring non-connected pools via ejecta seeding.

**✓** Pool genesis is INDEPENDENT of void genesis. Both operate on the same planet, driven by mostly independent variables. Pool genesis requires: stable terminator ammonia pools + atmospheric SiH₄ + lightning + some metal source. Monadnock/tower proximity helps (lightning rod, nutrient rain, metal delivery) but is not required. If pool genesis is possible at all, it does not require tight coupling to the deep-rock fracture system.

**✓** Tower as evolutionary engine: void genesis (→ towers) inadvertently drives pool genesis forward. (1) Geyser ejecta provides chronic fine catalytic dust to all terminator pools = **nutrient rain** (metal micronutrient capsules — small fragments passivate fast, release metals as ammine complexes). (2) Rare critical-mass fragments reach distant pools with enough catalytic activity to locally disrupt pool chemistry = **punctuated disturbance** (competes for SiH₄, deposits PCS, forces displacement). Size-dependent migration is the filter: smallest fragments travel farthest, passivate fastest, pose least threat. Large dangerous fragments stay near cone. The disturbance tempo is tunable (geyser energy, fracture density, pool spacing — all geological variables that vary along the 62,000 km terminator).

**✓** Chelation origin: evolves as metal-MINING from catalytic PCS fragments, not as immune defense. Silazane chemistry naturally coordinates transition metals (N lone-pair donation). Coacervates contacting fragment surfaces → non-specific metal uptake → selection for better extraction → proto-chelation enzymes → organisms that passivate fragments on contact (neutralize threat + harvest metals). Later exaptation: chelation aimed at other organisms' metalloenzymes → immune kill mode → calibrated toll mode → symbiote authentication. Chelation is the foundational biological metal economy.

**✓** Preadaptation gradient: organisms in tower-active terminator zones accumulate tower-contact experience across generations. Repeated displacement by catalytic fragments + proximity to tower chemistry → SiC-surface familiarity, metal-profile compatibility, signal exposure tolerance. Selection history, not birthright. Tower doesn't manufacture symbiotes — tower byproducts create the selection regime that produces organisms pre-adapted for eventual symbiosis.

**✓** Void genesis (→ towers) is the expected outcome of any suitable planet's chemistry. Pool genesis (→ mobile life) is a rare conjunction requiring stable terminator ammonia + atmospheric SiH₄ + lightning + metal sources + sufficient time. Tower activity provides the punctuated disturbance regime that drives evolution via catalytic ejecta. Most tower-bearing planets never produce mobile life. Pool genesis only needs to succeed once — wind dispersal populates all towers. The two genesis pathways are synergistic: towers build structure, pool genesis builds life, tower byproducts are the evolutionary engine of pool life.

**✓** One-way door: pre-biotic volcanic SiC already erodes silicate terrain at ~600 mm/Myr. After pool genesis → symbiotes → dead-bug plume, biological SiC dramatically accelerates peneplain formation. Genesis conditions erased. Abiogenesis unrepeatable.

**✓** Proto-tower construction — geyser-built volcanic cone: when deep-rock reaction front reaches pool floor via fracture, vent opens. Throat zone narrows (PCS deposition in gas phase), seals (PCS membrane forms), back-pressure builds, membrane fractures — geyser burst ejects PCS debris + gas + ammonia into pool. Ejecta deposits in rings around vent (circular debris field). Inner ring cements fastest (highest SiH₄ flux). Cone grows upward through pool as rings stack. Vent channel stays clear (scoured by each burst). Cone breaches pool surface → lightning rod → first strike ceramifies tip → conductive N:SiC → proto-tower established. Miniature volcanic cone morphology.

**✓** Geyser ejecta dynamics: catalytically active PCS fragments (embedded Ni, Fe, Ti, Co nanoparticles) ejected in rings around vent. Size-dependent behavior: large fragments (mm+) stay near cone, cement rapidly (high SiH₄ flux), become part of proto-tower base. Small fragments (10–100 μm) travel far, have few metal centers, passivate fast in ammonia (surface aminolysis + metal leaching as ammine complexes, days to weeks). Critical-mass fragments (intermediate, stochastic) occasionally reach distant pools with enough catalytic activity to disrupt local chemistry before passivating. Fracture-connected pools fill in years to decades (geyser + catalytic exterior growth + ejecta welding). **Genesis does NOT occur in fracture-connected pools** — they fill too fast (My-scale needed).

**⚠** Cone-wall dimorphism (DOWNGRADED — secondary effect at most): if protolife predates the tower arrival at a given pool (independent genesis model), the volcanic cone is a bulldozer that displaces existing protolife, not a nursery that creates it. Cone may still impose spatial selection on ALREADY-FORKED lineages during displacement, but is not the cause of the fork. The lineage fork (coacervation → amorphs, amphiphile assembly → sexuals) operates in open pools independent of cone geometry (Pool Genesis Hub §4).

**✓** Lightning: continuous at terminator. Triboelectric + low dielectric strength = frequent moderate discharge.

**✓** Thunder at 8 bar: shockwave, not just sound. Lightning channel expands into 8× Earth air density. Continuous terminator thunder = continuous overpressure bombardment. Physically damaging at ranges where Earth thunder is merely loud. Terminator acoustic environment is brutal. Dark side is silent. Tower interior provides acoustic shielding.

**✓** Lightning = Miller-Urey engine. Plasma-enhanced CVD produces complex organosilicon. Still running. Origin of life is ongoing.

**✓** H₂O at genesis sites: void genesis protected by reducing buffer (metallic Si consumes H₂O). Pool genesis protected by distillation shield (fresh terminator pools <1 ppm H₂O). Open sea hostile (~50 ppm, 89% hydrolysis) but not a genesis site. Pool-to-sea transition = evolutionary bottleneck requiring anti-petrification defense.

Wind power: ~3.5 kW/m² at terminator (Earth best: ~1–2 kW/m²).

Dynamic pressure at terminator: 370 Pa (≈ 25 m/s on Earth).

## DEEP-ROCK BIOSPHERE

**✓** Deep-rock is the TRUNK. Towers are branches. Amorphs are fruit.

**✓** Oldest life. Chemolithotrophic. Geothermal SiH₄ percolating through fracture networks. Same core metabolism as surface life, different source.

**✓** Deposits N-doped SiC as metabolic waste (= conductive mineral = lattice precursor).

**✓** Multiple independent systems in isolated fracture networks. Different protocols, different metabolic quirks.

**✓** Each system independently evolves towers when reaching surface. Convergent — physics dictates. Gross morphology identical, signals incompatible.

**✓** Surface roots evolve to manage megafauna; secondarily bridge geological gaps between systems, triggering network wars.

**✓** Network expansion: root network spreads from mature towers. Network ping rules determine when a new tower buds FROM the root. Bud creates a voltage/signal gradient. Tower-coupled symbiotes (Healers, Miners, Guards) follow gradient in propagule-distribution state, maintaining Schottky coupling with conductive root surface for energy en route. Journey is generational if distance requires — symbiote populations reproduce along the root, maintaining the migration front. Amorphs are NOT involved in colonization (they are megafauna transport layer, not colonization couriers).

**✓** Symbiote co-evolution constraint: tower-coupled symbiotes function ONLY in the signal environment they co-evolved with. Symbiote transfer to a foreign network is impossible — the chelation badges, signal protocols, and lattice-coupling parameters are network-specific. A tower without its co-evolved symbiote population is metabolically minimal (chemistry only on active face, no metal delivery, no surface maintenance, slow growth).

**✓** Deep-rock survives atmospheric crisis (geothermal, not atm-dependent). Crisis kills branches, not trunk.

**✓** Day-side subsurface network: young, repeatedly pruned by volcanism. Dark-side: ancient, rarely interrupted (dark-side plume breakthrough every ~500 Myr–1 Gyr can sever connections → fragmentation source for post-unification wars).

**✓** Deep-rock is NOT an organism. It is a chemically active face — a reaction front of metallosilazane catalytic chemistry — with a trail of dead (inert) lattice behind it. No bounded body. No reproduction. The front self-perpetuates as long as feedstock (SiH₄) and energy (geothermal) are available. Multiple independent fronts share a supply chain from a single vent.

**✓** No active tail. Behind the advancing front, pore throats narrow below SiH₄ molecular diameter (~4.1 Å) but above H₂ (~2.9 Å). Dead fill is H₂-permeable, SiH₄-opaque (molecular sieve). Isolated pores = functionally solid. All catalytic activity confined to the advancing face. No distributed reactor behind the front.

**✓** Reaction front advance — three rate regimes: (1) Gas-transport colonization of new fractures: ~mm/s, geologically instantaneous. (2) Channel-fed active deposition: ~μm/s, declining as pores narrow. (3) Matrix-diffusion stasis: ~5 nm/yr when all connected fractures filled (D_eff ≈ 2×10⁻¹⁰ m²/s through tight rock).

**✓** Exothermic thermal self-fracturing: ΔH = −33 kJ/mol (SiH₄ + CH₄ → SiC + 4H₂). Filling a 1mm fracture heats adjacent ~1cm rock shell by ~20K — at silicate thermal cracking threshold. The reaction cracks its own host rock at depth, creating new fractures for self-propagation. Self-propagating mechanically, not just chemically.

**✓** Chimney self-selection: surface-connected fractures maintain open gas channels (chimney draft = short residence time; shallow zone too cold for significant PCS deposition). Dead-end fractures fill solid (no draft → long residence → deposition → seal). Network self-prunes to efficient conduits. Surface-connected paths = permanent chimneys (gas pipe + electrical insulator). Dead ends = solid lattice.

**✓** PCS gap mechanism: lightning ceramifies PCS from above (I²R heating at SiC/PCS interface, attenuated by accumulated SiC column resistance — scales as ~1/R²_total). Geothermal ceramifies from below (fixed by thermal gradient, ~10–21 km depth at 30–60 K/km). Gap = kilometers of insulating PCS between two active ceramification fronts. Robust under all plausible parameters. Gap forces lateral root expansion for grounding.

Same chemistry, different calibration, gated by molecular handshake. Kill mode ancestral; toll mode derived. |

**✓** Physical: polysilane linked-list. Short fragments with terminal addressing (end-caps). Each fragment = one recipe. Quaternary side-chain code (H, CH₃, NH₂, SiH₃) with electronic readout.

**✓** Three currencies: Physical (SiC plates), Chemical (recipes/fragments), Cognitive (experiential/merge-only). Not fungible.

**✓** Two axes of speciation (amorphs): cognitive protocol compatibility + library addressing compatibility. Both needed. Either can diverge independently.

**✓** Four axes of speciation (middle kingdom): cognitive protocol + library addressing + hook-lattice pore geometry + chelation badge compatibility. All four must match for an organism to survive on a given tower lineage. Chelation badge = biological public-key authentication (easy to verify, hard to forge). Network wars drove key complexity via forgery/detection arms race.

**✓** Reproduction: cognitive = regression-to-consensus; library = discrete probabilistic inheritance. Recipes outlive derivations.

**✓** Copying: transcriptive (read → buffer → synthesize). Not template-directed. Analog noise accumulates → regression to consensus.

## THREE-TIER LIFE ARCHITECTURE

> **Cross-reference:** For structural materials, body plans, and mechanical engineering of all three tiers, see **Fauna Structural Engineering Hub**. For lineage origins, see **Pool Genesis Hub §4**.

**⚠** No plant/animal distinction. No photosynthesis. No autotroph/heterotroph divide. All life runs on electrical charge from different sources (grid, solar-electric, SiH₄ metabolism). Organizing axes: phylogeny (amorph vs. sexual), energy source (tower-coupled vs. tower-independent), motility (sessile vs. mobile). "Plant" and "flora" are convenience labels only.

**✓** Microbial: amorph, catalytic, no body plan, thermodynamic minimum, division/merge, horizontal exchange.

**✓** Middle kingdom: SEXUAL, genomic, rigid body plans. Two size regimes:
- **Tower-coupled** (Healers, Miners, Guards): mm to ~2 cm. Energy-limited by Schottky contact extraction from lattice. Tap grid; repay in surface maintenance, metal delivery, quality control.
- **Free-living** (subwoofers, thorn-flora, soaring organisms): up to ~30 cm. Self-powered (atmospheric SiH₄, wind, solar-electric). Gel actuator ceiling: active walking ≤5–8 cm; anchored/semi-sessile up to ~30 cm. Above 30 cm = amorph territory.
Individual learning only — no inherited memory.

**✓** Megafauna: amorph, catalytic, reconfigurable generalists. Self-powered. Free-ranging. Inherited memory via budding (selective) and merge (complete, destructive).

**✓** Amorphs are the transport layer: only self-powered organisms that cross gaps between towers.

## ECOLOGY KEY FACTS

**✓** Middle kingdom: sessile majority. Most tower fauna fixed in place for life. Die in place when tower dies.

**✓** Healers, Miners, Guards, railgun projectiles, Voronoi armor: all at INSECT SCALE on the lattice (tower-coupled size regime).

**✓** Network manages middle kingdom via lattice energy-gradient modulation (tropism — organisms follow voltage, not signals). Manages amorphs via subtle behavioral signals (feels like own thoughts).

**✓** Fluorine biochemistry: entire adaptive radiation around volcanic provinces. Multiple lineages weaponize F. SiF₄ volatilization (tissue gasses off). Ecological axis, not single niche.

**✓** Fluorine pollination: thorn-flora (sexual/genomic). Thorns ARE the reproductive propagules — every thorn is a seed + pollen vehicle + defense (triple function). Customers charge from pads adjacent to thorn bodies, pick up thorns, carry to next plant → cross-pollination. Vipers = premium dispersal (thorn-seeds into corpses near CaF₂). Federated organism: dedicated thorn bodies (fruiting/defense, protecting root-capacitor storage), root-capacitor bank. Dual-source energy: geothermal (ancestral, armed, vent-zone — thermoelectric roots into hot volcanic rock, simplest engineering) + solar (derived, unarmed, widespread — heliostat reflector canopy + PV organ, more complex). The two sources are complementary: geothermal peaks at terminator (max ΔT), solar peaks at substellar. Terminator exclusion is ecological (tower competition), not physical. Day-side dominance because towers can't survive there.

**✓** Thorn-flower pollination: two pollinator guilds. (1) Vipers — premium dispersal, range freely, always carry multi-flower pollen. (2) Small balloon organisms — accidental pollinators. Shelter in thorn-flower lee (reduced wind), constantly contact pollen organs, occasionally wind-displaced to neighboring flowers carrying foreign pollen. Not deliberate — side effect of sheltering behavior. Thorn-flower enforces cross-pollination via chemical novelty-gradient gating: charging pads run a diversity assay on pollen payload. More distinct non-self sources = more charge. The plant's real problem is UPWIND gene flow (wind handles downwind for free). Novelty reward implicitly rewards upwind delivery because upwind pollen is rare/novel at any given flower (wind creates directional gene-flow bias in the population). Balloons carrying leeward pollen upwind deliver maximally novel payload → maximum reward. Venturi drag-reduction body plan enables the upwind mobility that accesses these high-paying flowers. Self-regulating equilibrium: if mechanism homogenizes gene pool, novelty gradient flattens, directional reward weakens, wind dominance reasserts, gradient re-establishes. Negative feedback.

**✓** Aposematic EM signatures: F-loaded organisms broadcast warning. One bad experience educates entire amorph lineage permanently. Sexual predators must learn each generation.

**✓** Balloon fauna: evolve from fall-survival (parachute → glider → balloon). Dual-organism at all scales: amorph membrane + sexual symbiont colony. Sexual organisms provide rigid gas cells (sealed SiC shells — superior H₂ barrier), structural framework (fused shells = reef architecture), MEMS actuators. Amorph provides envelope, cognition (minimal — tropism-level), metabolic processing, energy distribution to colony. Structural innovation paced by sexual genome (fast); amorph hosting behavior paced by meme evolution via transcription errors (slow — the bottleneck). Venturi duct geometry emerges from two amorph reward gradients: preferential feeding to symbiont regions that (a) reduce drag and (b) increase power harvest. No design intelligence required — convergence on optimal geometry from two local tropisms. Born aloft, live aloft, die aloft. Propulsion: wide design space — whole-body fin waving (smallest, no venturi), flagella/amorph tendrils (small, transitional), longitudinal fin undulation on rigid venturi body (dominant mid-range — body stays stiff, external fin ripples, cuttlefish/knifefish analog), electric rotary motors with SiC piezoelectric drive and metal silicide bearings (large-scale — ducted fans). All viable; ecology has native electrical power, piezoelectric materials, and low-friction bearing materials. Constraint: propulsion must not deform the venturi duct. No chemical rockets (no oxidizer; F₂-H₂ is a weapon, not propulsion).

**✓** Balloon fauna = network's blind spot. Outside EM range. Cross between tower territories. Carry biology across colonial boundaries.

**✓** Small-scale balloon ecology: venturi body plan works at ALL biologically relevant scales as DRAG REDUCTION device (reduces station-keeping cost from full dynamic pressure 370 Pa to skin friction ~30–50 Pa equivalent). MEMS flaps maladaptive below ~cm scale (Re transitions to viscous regime). Small balloons shelter in lee of towers/thorn-flowers where wind is reduced; crude fin propulsion in 8.2 kg/m³ air provides meaningful mobility (~7× Earth thrust per fin stroke). Aposematic fluorine-loaded balloon variants: CaF₂ crystallites alter dielectric properties → distinctive passive EM signature (honest, unfakeable, physical property of crystal structure). Two defense tiers: passive (predator gut acid + CaF₂ → internal HF) and active (bombardier beetle analog, HF spray at bite point). Shelter in thorn-flower/tower lee zones over volcanic provinces where CaF₂ is available.

**✓** Intermediate-scale balloon fauna (~5 cm to ~5 m): structural continuum from loose shell colony in amorph membrane → partial reef patches → fused rigid segments with amorph-filled articulated joints. Key transition at ~1 m: reef patches start fusing into continuous load-bearing structure (below: amorph holds shape; above: reef holds shape). Propulsion vs. drift is a continuum, not a dichotomy — organisms range from pure drifters to full station-keepers, with most using the atmospheric conveyor for transport and propulsion for hunting/maneuvering (fish in a current, not plankton).

**✓** Intermediate balloon fauna — four guilds: (1) **Nursery hunters** (~5–30 cm, dark side): patrol permanent convergence zones where propagules germinate. Low wind = propulsion gives maximum advantage. Sharks of the nursery. (2) **Plume hawks** (~10 cm to ~1 m, tower-adjacent): hold station in tower lee, intercept dead-bug plume. First access to freshest material (unlocked catalytic metals, intact library fragments). Compete directly with ground-based dead-bug harvesters — what the hawk catches, the ground harvester doesn't. (3) **Rain-wall ambush predators** (~50 cm to several meters, terminator): station-keep at day-ward edge of rain-wall. Prey funnel — all dark-side traffic funnels through. Hunt energy-depleted, disoriented organisms. Need strong propulsion for ~9.5 m/s sustained wind. Apex of intermediate food web. Largest propulsive intermediates. (4) **Circuit riders** (all sizes, planetary): active predators within the drifter circuit. Use conveyor for transport, propulsion for hunting. Not drifters, not station-keepers — wolves among the caribou herd. Sea-skimming does NOT scale down: amorphs sink in NH₃ (1050 vs 660 kg/m³), pseudopod reach too short below ~10 m. Sea-dipping is skywhale-exclusive.

**✓** Skywhales: extreme endpoint of balloon fauna coevolution. Venturi dirigible body plan: fused SiC-shell reef forming rigid duct, MEMS-flap sexual organisms lining interior, amorph membrane wrapping and permeating colony. Peristaltic feeding tentacles dip into terminator ammonia seas for catalytic metals (dissolved ammine complexes) and metabolizable feedstock (→ H₂ replenishment). Three-phase cycle: charge (drift day-ward), atmospheric feed (sprint night-ward via venturi), sea-dip (descend over basins, deploy tentacles). Discharge spines bleed excess charge via corona/arc. Functionally immortal within operating range. Largest molecular library on the planet (amorph membrane mass). Biologically isolated in high-wind band near terminator.

**✓** Drifter cycle (pure balloon fauna): pelagic food web mapped onto atmospheric circulation. Trajectory: substellar chimney (lofted to altitude) → superstream return (~6–12 days at ~20–40 m/s; thermally-driven overturning, not superrotation) → dark-side condensation descent (variable latitude — most organisms descend 20–40° past terminator, NOT at anti-stellar) → dark-side surface transit (S-shaped Coriolis path, duration depends on descent latitude: ~7–15 days for mid-dark-side descent, ~35 days for anti-stellar) → terminator rain-wall → day-side transit (~12 days, gas-phase feeding) → repeat. Total circuit: ~30–65 days depending on descent latitude, across 1–N generations depending on size class. Short-circuit organisms (descend early) stay in higher-wind zones; long-circuit organisms (descend near anti-stellar) traverse the calm interior.

**✓** Rain-wall is a SIZE FILTER, not a barrier. Sorts by single reflex: rain (= liquid NH₃ = food) hits membrane → metabolize → produce H₂ → inflate. Three outcomes: sink (tower food), rise (return flow → short cycle), hold level (through to day side → long cycle). Small organisms: high mortality, rain overwhelms lift. Large organisms: rain is just food falling from sky, fly through without noticing. Air between surface and superstream shear is non-turbulent — no barrier for anything above threshold size.

**✓** Drifter predation: highest-quality food at every phase is other drifters (concentrated pre-processed silicon biochemistry vs. dilute atmospheric filter-feeding). Predation drives size hierarchy. Multi-circuit veterans eat first-circuit survivors. Each lap = compound growth (atmospheric baseline + predation on everything smaller). Dark-side nursery, rain-wall approach, day-side transit, superstream return — all are predation zones. Population self-limits through predation pressure.

**✓** Drifter reproduction: size-graduated lifecycle. Small (first circuit): semelparous — spawn at substellar chimney, propagules ride superstream back. Medium (multi-circuit): iteroparous — personally survives superstream return on accumulated reserves, grows each lap. Large (terminal): chimney shear exceeds structural integrity → involuntary fragmentation distributes propagules into superstream. Propagules attach to parent fragments ("yolk" — energy/material reserve for superstream transit + dark-side germination). More circuits = bigger parent = bigger fragments = better-provisioned propagules. Reproductive payoff for longevity is exponential via predatory compound interest. Germination trigger: dark-side ammonia rain. Sexual lineage: pre-formed propagules on parent fragment. Amorph lineage: fragmentation IS reproduction (every chunk = new organism).

**✓** Wind-surfing: organisms ride wind between towers. Lattice is a catch-net (open structure decelerates in turbulent interior). Oldest dispersal mechanism. Inherited skill in amorphs.

**✓** Marine glass-shell organisms (diatom analogs): SiO₂ armor from controlled surface petrification. Zero SiH₄ cost. Self-passivating, self-healing. Middle Kingdom / microbial marine adaptation. Large amorphs shed glass; small organisms keep it.

## AMMONIA SEA ECOLOGY

**✓** Ammonia ocean = hybrid of hot acid spring + deep hydrothermal vent ecology. The solvent is food (NH₃ is a metabolic co-substrate with SiH₄ for silazane synthesis). SiH₄ is the limiting nutrient, not ammonia. Marine ecology organized by SiH₄ distribution: dense life near sources (surface dissolution, rain-input deltas, hydrothermal vents), sparse elsewhere.

**✓** Petrification dominates marine ecology. Sea H₂O ~50 ppm (8× the 6 ppm "untenable" threshold). Every marine organism fights constant chemical attack. The metabolic cost is both external (surface contact) and internal (feeding throughput — every mouthful of ammonia carries H₂O). Two opposing size curves: external petrification cost drops with size (surface-to-volume), internal petrification cost rises with size (feeding throughput). Optimal size depends on local SiH₄/H₂O ratio.

**✓** Glass spines: baseline marine defense. Any wound exposes living tissue to 50 ppm ambient H₂O. Glass spines (from controlled petrification) puncture predators, creating petrification entry wounds. Minimum viable marine defense. Universal, not specialized.

**✓** Biological distillation: key marine adaptation. Glass-lined internal chamber (petrification endpoint — free, H₂O-proof). Organism heats slightly or reduces pressure (expand float bladder) → NH₃ vaporizes (bp ~240K), H₂O stays liquid (bp 373K). Clean NH₃ vapor routed to living tissue. H₂O residue concentrated and stored. Living tissue never contacts H₂O. Converts petrification tax from material repair cost to energy cost. Organisms with distillation dominate; those without are marginal.

**✓** Medusa-fish: apex marine organism. Distillation waste (concentrated H₂O) weaponized. Lionfish body plan — rigid shell, corona of hollow glass spines connected to pressurized H₂O reservoir via glass-lined plumbing. Tesla valve (no-moving-parts check valve, manufactured by petrifying a shaped tissue template) separates float bladder (H₂ gas, pressure source) from reservoir (concentrated H₂O). Squeeze bladder → gas pressure through Tesla valve → forces water out through glass intake/spines. All water-contacting surfaces are glass. Zero moving parts in weapon system. Three delivery modes: passive (distributed sub-shell bladders — predator breaches shell, contacts water, mouth petrifies), contact spray (water ejected through glass intake — short range in ammonia, longer in air), injection (hollow glass spines puncture target, pressurized water delivered internally). Apex by inedibility — K ≈ 10⁵ is thermodynamic, no resistance possible. Self-sterilizing interior (no parasites survive concentrated H₂O). Amorph body inside shell; shell possibly dual-organism (sexual symbiont SiC/glass structure). Mobile reef: defenseless organisms cluster in spine corona for protection, acting as unwitting bait attracting predators to the spines. Marine analog of the tower — mobile habitat node around which local food web organizes.

**✓** Marine buoyancy: everything sinks in ammonia (amorph 1050 vs NH₃ 660 kg/m³). H₂ gas bladders provide ~659 kg/m³ buoyancy per unit volume — 80× more effective than atmospheric H₂ lift. H₂ is metabolic waste. Flexible amorph membrane at ambient pressure (swim bladder, not pressure vessel). Depth control by gas production/venting.

**✓** Involuntary broadcast: liquid ammonia (dielectric constant ~22) couples to amorph electronic neural processing. In air, EM emission is directional and attenuates with distance. In liquid NH₃, the high-dielectric polar medium converts emission to near-field ionic/electrical coupling — effectively omnidirectional conduction through the solvent. Marine amorphs can't think privately. Small, fast-metabolizing, short-lived. Shore amorphs are bilingual (broadcast/private). Conductive shells (N-doped SiC) provide partial Faraday cage shielding.

**✓** Marine zonation: surface film (atmospheric SiH₄ dissolution, glass-shell diatom mats), rain-input deltas (terminator, nutrient-rich, highest biomass), vent communities (hydrothermal SiH₄, dense local ecosystems, possible deep-rock biosphere connection), shore/intertidal (richest — dual SiH₄ access, reduced H₂O exposure), deep floor (barren glass fossil pavement). Sea-dipping is skywhale-exclusive (drowning risk below ~10 m organism scale).

**✓** Marine crisis: aquatic life is the canary. H₂O ratchet concentrates water in seas. Marine extinction precedes terrestrial crisis. Vulnerability gradient: deep sea → shallow sea → coastal → land → towers.

**✓** Petrification as decomposition analog: living organisms fight K ≈ 10⁵ through metabolic repair. Death → petrification proceeds to equilibrium → glass fossil. Aging = accumulation of unrepairable petrification scars + other damage. Dead persist as translucent silicon-mineral solids.

**✓** "Getting glassed" (acute H₂O surface exposure): self-limiting (Deal-Grove √t). Large amorphs: prank-tier for small splash on bulk tissue, assault for targeted/internal delivery. Severity scales with dose, location, and inverse body size.

**✓** Tower-death exodus: millions of mobile fauna stream from leeward face when grid fails. Sessile 95%+ dies in place silently. Cascade propagates downwind during crisis.

Parasites: genomic fragments (selfish elements), boundary infiltrators, signal parasites (Toxoplasma analog), autocatalytic hijackers (viral analog).

Arms races: Healer armor vs Guard penetrators (drove neural complexity). Collector composite vs Guard offensive strategies.

**✓** Dead-bug plume: garbage-collector Healer sub-caste clears dead symbiotes from lattice (maintains airflow + conductivity). Dead organisms enter windstream, carried day-ward. Continuous plume from every tower. Terminator rain belt temporarily captures plume particulate into liquid ammonia sheet flow, but rain belt is a BUFFER not a wall — ammonia evaporates at day-side ~240K boundary, dried particulate re-enters atmospheric conveyor. Permanent sinks: grass/breakwater mounds (tower-base sediment interception), sea beds, biological incorporation. **Plume is post-recycling waste** — tower has stripped all biologically recoverable value. If ejecta had value, towers that recycled would outcompete. SiC shells with locked metals = zero-value to tower.

**✓** Dead-bug harvesting: ecological niche and pre-industrial amorph industry. Airborne interception (freshest — metals, library fragments) + ammonia runoff filtering (volume — SiC plates, partially locked metals). Tower-derived SiC plates (~5mm) and metals are primary harvestable resources. Pre-industrial metal extraction from plume deposits: gather → tumble → magnetic sort (lightning-magnetized native iron). Ancient deposits become ore bodies when arc furnaces arrive. See Industrialization Hub §1.4.

## EM ECOLOGY

**✓** Cognition = EM emission. Amorph neural processing (semiconductor junctions, doped regions) generates detectable EM radiation as a physical byproduct. All thinking organisms broadcast cognitive state. Not a design flaw — a consequence of electronic signaling. Detection range scales with neural mass and processing intensity.

**✓** Three-layer signaling (Amorph Daily Life Hub §8.3.1): (1) **Involuntary emission** — physical byproduct, honest signal, autonomic tells (pupil dilation equivalent). Cannot be encrypted. (2) **Deliberate emotional conventions** — learned EM patterns (amorph "smile", cultural gestures). Conscious, performative. Can contradict Layer 1. (3) **Deliberate communication** — structured semantic content (radio, 100 MHz–2 GHz). Encryptable with salted asymmetric-key crypto. Monk Layer 1 control = EM poker face.

**✓** Short-range mutual awareness (individual): individual EM detection range is short — conversational to social distance. 8-bar atmosphere at 12.5% NH₃ absorbs strongly across much of the EM spectrum. An individual amorph's EM sense is intimate — rich emotional/cognitive context in face-to-face interaction, NOT radar.

**✓** Tower as EM sensor (AWACS): the Faraday cage effect IS the detection mechanism. External EM signals induce surface currents on the conductive lattice — those currents cancel the field inside, and the network reads the currents as signal. The tower's entire corpus is the antenna — not optimised for detection (tower morphology is shaped by wind filtration and accretion, not EM reception), but sheer scale (cross-section hundreds of meters) provides massive aperture that compensates for poor efficiency. Sensitivity is angle-dependent: tower cross-section elongated in wind direction, windward/leeward surface geometry asymmetric → reduced reception from some bearings. NOT perfect omnidirectional coverage. Multiple towers partially compensate (one tower's blind spot covered by adjacent towers at different angles). Roots extend the sensor perimeter as ground-level tripwire grid (conductive lattice on peneplain surface; contact/approach detectable via surface-current sensing regardless of tower blind spots). Smart predators avoid stepping on roots. The network has strong but imperfect situational awareness of its territory. Whether this benefits any particular organism depends on the network sharing the information.

**✓** Subwoofer EM phased array (Fauna Hub §6.5): the exception to short-range detection. A distributed pack of 10–25 subwoofers, each with EM receiver organs, cross-correlates involuntary prey emissions to achieve directional sensitivity and detection range beyond any individual organism. Pack IS the antenna. Dual-domain predator: find by EM, kill by sound. Prey cannot hide while thinking, cannot stop thinking without losing acoustic defenses.

**✓** Predator strategies (6 — all operate at close range): (1) **Go cognitively dark** — suppress neural processing for final approach. Committed strike; once dark, cannot adapt. Default ambush strategy. (2) **Pursuit predation** — loud and fast. Outrun, don't hide. (3) **Ambush in EM noise** — hunt near towers, volcanic vents where background masks cognitive signature. (4) **Conductive shell Faraday cage** — N-doped SiC shell attenuates EM emission. Reduces already-short detection range further. (5) **Cognitive mimicry** — match background EM pattern. "Think like prey" during approach. (6) **Trap predation** — passive traps, cognitive withdrawal during capture. Ancestral strategy.

**✓** Prey counter-strategies (5): (1) **Detect and flee** — EM detection is symmetric at close range. If predator is close enough to sense you, you sense it. Flee before strike range. (2) **Group living** — confusion effect at close range, plus degrades subwoofer phased-array targeting. (3) **Herd SIGINT** — group acts as distributed phased-array EM detector, sweeping for predator emissions. Most effective against subwoofers (which remain EM-active during approach); least effective against cognitively-dark ambush predators (low EM signature during committed strike). (4) **Tower lattice as EM shelter** — conductive lattice acts as Faraday cage. Blocks EM detection from outside (including subwoofer phased array). Fundamental ecological service. (5) **Be inedible** — fluorine loading, glass spines, medusa-fish water weapons.

**✓** Erratic prey movement counters cognitively-dark predators: unpredictable movement causes committed strike to miss. Predator must re-compute → neural activity resumes → EM emission resumes → prey detects re-engagement. Forces iterative dark/compute/dark cycles.

**✓** Tower lattice as EM shelter: conductive N-doped SiC lattice acts as partial Faraday cage. Interior organisms shielded from external EM detection — especially important against subwoofer phased-array detection. Fundamental ecological service: not just structure and energy, but EM privacy. Inter-tower gaps are dangerous (wind, thunder, acoustic exposure, subwoofer packs) — drives concentration of mobile fauna on towers.

## TOWERS

### Construction Model

**✓** Tower has no genome. No body plan. Responds to local real-time measurements only (stress, wind, material intake, electrical potential). Ceramified lattice is permanent — cannot un-ceramify. Additive manufacturing with feedback, minus the plan.

**✓** Four growth phases over deep time: (1) **Autocatalytic mineral accretion** — lightning forges heavy molecules from atmosphere, hypercyclic catalytic reactions on tower surface assemble into more lattice. Reaction grows isotropically: vertical (tower) + lateral along exposed fracture traces (proto-roots, amplified by PCS gap resistance crossover — see below). No biology. (2) **Symbiote colonization** — aeroplankton arrive, tap grid power, initially parasitic (occupy catalytic surface, consume SiH₄). (3) **Mutualism and reef transition** — Healer genomes accumulate architectural information via energy-gradient tropism selection. Tower transitions from mineral deposit to biological construction (reef/termite mound). (4) **Ship of Theseus renewal** — Healers progressively replace all original material in situ. Every tower position ancient; every tower's material renewed. No old towers on mature network.

**✓** Symbiote genomes = tower construction program. Healer genomes encode deposition/demolition behavior. Miner genomes encode metal delivery. Guard genomes encode quality control. Network behavioral patterns = project manager (energy-gradient modulation). Tower is the product; symbiotes carry the blueprints. **Programmable model:** symbiote genomes encode deterministic signal-response primitives (logic gates). Tower composes complex behavior from sequences of simple signals. Convergent architecture = firmware standardization across networks.

**✓** Tower morphogenesis: complex tower geometry emerges from simple symbiote signal-response via reaction-diffusion (Turing pattern) dynamics. Symbiotes respond to local signal gradients AND modify the signal environment as they build (deposited structure changes local conductivity, impedance, field geometry). Coupled feedback loops produce emergent spatial patterns — airfoil cross-section, chimney placement, fairy ring geometry, strut branching angles — without any entity holding a blueprint. Analogous to embryonic development: cells follow chemical gradients mediated by the cells themselves. Replaces need for genetic algorithms or design intelligence. Convergent architecture across independent networks = same physics, same reaction-diffusion attractors.

**✓** Amorph Healer direction: amorphs learn tower signal protocols by listening and replaying. The construction-command library is a transferable meme. "Domestication" = protocol acquisition, not selective breeding. Some breeding may be needed to suppress autonomic behaviors (tower-homing, substrate authentication). See Industrialization Hub §3.

**✓** Healers are builders AND wreckers. Arc + CVD feedstock = construction (deposit SiCN). Arc without feedstock = destruction (vaporize SiC at ~2700°C). Same tool, two modes. Subtractive capability: remove suboptimal structure, carve chimney channels, excavate amorph chambers, progressive renovation.

**✓** Tower aliveness spectrum (not binary): full reef (all guilds, Healer-directed, network-connected) → degraded reef (patchy symbiotes, weakening) → reaction front only (no symbiotes, crude autocatalytic, disconnected) → inert (passivated, fossil ceramics). "Reaction front only" is an early-life state (Phase 1), not achievable by degradation of a modern tower. Modern crisis pathway: full reef → degraded → inert (skips reaction-front-only).

**✓** Catalytic surface is dead in all fully-renewed (Ship of Theseus) towers. Healer SiCN lacks catalytic metallosilazane sites (metals not in atmospheric CVD feedstock). Modern towers cannot revert to Phase 1 autocatalytic growth. Dependence on symbiotes is absolute and irreversible.

**✓** Pre-Healer root mechanism: same Phase 1 autocatalytic surface reaction, growing laterally along exposed fracture traces. Resistance crossover amplifies: as PCS gap downward ceramification stalls (power ∝ 1/R²_total), lightning current shifts to lateral surface paths (Kirchhoff). Pre-biotic proto-roots — dendritic, fracture-following. Healers inherit and optimize.

### Shape and Structure

**✓** Cross-section: symmetric airfoil (plan view). Blunt convex windward face (arch in cross-wind direction), tapers to trailing edge with chimney vents. Not a column — a thin curved wall. "Membrane held up by an arch."

**✓** Functional filter depth: 2–3 m from windward face. ~450 strut layers. SiH₄ and particulate depleted. Beyond this: structural + chimney infrastructure only.

**✓** H₂ chimney: core metabolism SiH₄ → SiC + 2H₂. H₂ buoyancy = 132 Pa/m. Over km height, chimney draft orders of magnitude stronger than wind (370 Pa). Venturi-enhanced trailing-edge vents (upper tower). Primary exhaust straight up through apex.

**✓** Regional shape continuum: airfoil (terminator, 9.5 m/s) → teardrop (near dark) → circular dome (anti-stellar, ~0 wind). v(θ) = v_term × (sin θ)^(−1/4). Filter zone thickens as wind decreases.

**✓** Height profile: wide deep buttressed base (30–50 m chord, 100–200+ m span) → thin blade apex (3–5 m chord, 20–60 m span). Gothic cathedral buttress silhouette. Base merges into root system via flares. Apex is broad ridge with gentle central peak.

**✓** Symbiote coating model: symbiotes coat strut surfaces (~2 mm strut → ~4–6 mm effective diameter), NOT plug pores. Pores remain open. ~80–85% opacity from multiple partially-obstructed layers in series. Windward shell generates broadband biological noise (coating damps clean vortex shedding). Clean Aeolian tones from bare interior struts only. Dead towers sound completely different (clean tones, more wind-transparent). See Tower Morphology Hub §3.3, §9.1.

**✓** Porosity gradient: 3–5% solids (top, light, youngest) to 10–15% solids (base, dense, Healer-renovated over Gyr). Gibson-Ashby scaling: 5% solids → ~9 MPa effective strength, H_max ~3100 m. Km-scale towers feasible.

### Stationary Towers

**✓** Towers are stationary. At v2.4 wind (9.5 m/s, q = 370 Pa), SiC aerogel strut strength (~20 MPa) exceeds wind-borne impact by 4–5 orders of magnitude. Pitting-only erosion, completely negated by Healer repair. Net erosion = zero. Position fixed at nucleation permanently.

**✓** Nucleation positions determined by Fibonacci ping-latency spacing (network signal optimization), not migration/replacement.

**✓** Convergent architecture: given geological time, all accessible towers Ship-of-Theseus replaced to current best model for each location. Regional variation reflects local conditions, not evolutionary history.

### Power Gradient

**✓** Terminator towers: power SURPLUS. Lightning + piezoelectric vibration + solar (850 nm matches Si bandgap). All electricity to piezoelectric entity. Problem is managing excess. Healer renovation energy-unconstrained.

**✓** Power declines dark-ward. Deep dark side: energy-poor, renovation rare, growth-history-constrained architecture. Anti-stellar: near-zero power, most primitive modern architecture.

**✓** Geothermal oasis exception: dark-side tower on SiH₄ pocket vent = terminator-class power in energy desert. Architecturally refined. Non-renewable (pocket depletes → tower degrades through aliveness spectrum). These become monk monasteries.

**✓** Nightside oasis tower (unique): single geological freak in the nightside ocean. Chemical seamount built on the central peak of a D ~80–150 km impact crater. Genesis mechanism: SiH₄ from deep-rock reaction front vents through impact fracture network at central peak → reacts with liquid ammonia → silazane/PCS precipitates → chimney grows from crater floor to ocean surface (trivially easy — needs <0.001% of SiH₄ flux, completes in <200 kyr). Above surface: geyser-cone mechanism operates in air, volcanic lightning (triboelectric from ejecta plumes) provides sporadic ceramification. Power source: geothermal thermoelectric gradient through SiC chimney structure (hot vent below, cold nightside atmosphere above) — continuous, inexhaustible. NOT on the grid (roots submerged in conductive ammonia, permanently shorted). NOT intelligent until initialized. One-of-a-kind — requires impact crater of right size, location, and fracture connectivity. **Location constraint: within ~400 km of terminator mound crest** (geometric LoS for EM relay — 1 km tower on ~3 km mound to 1 km tower on island; island elevation and taller towers extend this). See Monks: proto-monk origin.

**✓** Tower lattice = signal-processing circuit (FPGA). Lattice geometry IS the computation — every junction, pore, conductive path is a circuit element. Healers reprogram the circuit by adding/removing structure. Dead tower (no Healers) = frozen processor running stale firmware. If root-connected, signals still flow through it. If disconnected, silent (no input, not incapable).

**✓** Ghost roots: subsurface root network connecting towers. Not migration artifacts (towers are stationary).

### Network Signaling

**✓** Packet-based signaling: adversarial ratchet drives toward framed, authenticated signal units. Network warfare requires friend/foe discrimination at signal level → framing, authentication headers, error detection. Not designed; evolved through signal warfare pressure.

**✓** Dual protocol: root-borne = TCP-like (point-to-point, reliable, framed, authenticated, boosted at each hop). EM-borne = UDP-like (broadcast, unreliable, no acknowledgment, authentication in frame).

**✓** Authentication trail: root-borne packets carry the authentication identity of every tower relayed through. Gives hop count + topology. No aggregate electrical measurements across multi-hop paths — signal boosted at each tower.

**✓** Signal boosting: each tower amplifies relay traffic (boosts without full decode). FPGA semiconductor junctions incidentally clean noise (threshold/reshaping). Somewhere between dumb booster and full repeater, falling out of junction physics. Enables planetary-scale network without signal degradation.

**✓** Two-speed signal: tower body = FPGA (gate delay, ~10³–10⁴ m/s). Roots = transmission line (~10⁸ m/s in N:SiC). Root attenuation: ~10–20 km unboosted range (~10 cm cross-section, N-doped SiC).

### Fairy Ring Antenna Arrays

**✓** Surface roots spawn antenna arrays ("fairy rings") at resistance-regular intervals. Each array: a ring of varying-height SiC stalks budding from a root node. Varying height provides 3D directional sensitivity (azimuth from ring geometry, elevation from height variation). Local FPGA at root node decodes received EM frames, computes 3D bearing + signal strength per source, sends report packets to tower via root.

**✓** Dual-purpose: SiC stalks are piezoelectric — antenna + wind energy harvesting in one structure. Informationally alive (FPGA-capable), unlike grass (informationally dead).

**✓** Tower aggregates reports from all fairy rings across all roots → 3D map of authenticated EM environment. This is the tower's primary spatial awareness system.

### Network Distribution

**✓** Fibonacci phyllotaxis (~137.5° golden angle). ~6 neighbors per tower. Actively steered: tower identifies largest angular gap in its EM environment (from fairy ring data), directs next root into that gap. Golden angle emerges from "always grow into the biggest gap." Geological noise produces irregular actual spacing; pattern is Fibonacci-ish, not precise.

**✓** Four-case root growth model (all evaluated from local information):

| Case | Trigger | Response |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Direct connection | EM-authenticated tower, only indirect root connection | Grow root toward it; both towers navigate via fairy rings, meet in middle |
| 2. Lost tower | EM-authenticated tower, NO root connection | Network-level reconnection protocol |
| 3. Enemy tower | EM signal, fails authentication | Network-level attack protocol |
| 4. New territory | No EM signal in a direction | Expand: grow root into gap; if viable substrate found → build new tower |

**✓** Root steering: tower monitors root growth direction via successive fairy ring bearing reports. Off-angle deviation → differential feeding (starve deviant side, feed corrective side). Same preferential-feeding tropism used for internal structure management. Geology forces deviations; tower corrects iteratively.

**✓** Spacing emerges from two constraints: (a) EM range sets maximum (root tip beyond EM range of all existing towers → Case 4 → build). (b) Root growth + substrate availability sets actual locations. Spacing is approximate, not precise — geological noise is inherent.

| Zone | Approx. spacing | Binding constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Terminator | ~6.5 km (avg) | Root signal range |
| Near dark | ~8–10 km (avg) | Root signal range |
| Mid dark | ~12–15 km (avg) | EM coverage |
| Deep dark | ~20 km (avg) | EM coverage |

**✓** Superconductors: never by network (CVD precision insufficient). Late amorph industrial tech.

**✓** Forest aerodynamic drag ~4× smooth surface at terminator, but non-binding (lightning-powered, net-zero materials, SiH₄ superabundant).

**✓** Material conveyor independent of forest. Mature towers net-zero (intake ≈ waste). Conveyor saturates at atmospheric carrying capacity. No engineered channels needed.

**✓** Three feedback mechanisms: (1) preferential-feeding self-regulation (dominant), (2) sediment-wedge stability lock (grass + breakwater field stabilizes accumulated surface → freezes existing pattern), (3) death cascade (crisis-mode only, propagates day-ward).

## PLANETARY NETWORK

**✓** Network wars (primordial): when surface roots from independent deep-rock systems first meet, foreign signals flood infrastructure optimized for self-signals. Flinch → retreat fails → forced engagement. Each system has independently evolved towers (void genesis = multiple independent events). Symbiotes share a common origin (pool genesis = singular event, wind-dispersed), but symbiote lineages diverge on different tower systems — different protocols, chelation badges, metabolic quirks. Both sides are near-peers.

**✓** Network wars (post-unification): after one network absorbs all rivals, new wars arise via FRAGMENTATION + PROTOCOL DRIFT. A geological event (dark-side plume breakthrough every ~500 Myr–1 Gyr, major magmatic intrusion) severs a root connection. The severing event must exceed the thermal tolerance of deep-rock extremophiles — minor vents are just habitat; only magma (1200K+) or sustained major fissures kill the living tissue while leaving dead lattice intact. Isolated halves drift in signal/chelation protocols at electronic neural speeds. Re-contact (when the geological barrier cools, potentially thousands of years later) = war between former siblings with incompatible authentication. Protocol close enough to recognize AS protocol, too different to accept.

**✓** Adversarial ratchet: signal discrimination → protocol analysis → forgery → forgery detection → theory of mind → self-modeling. Intelligence WITHOUT consciousness.

**✓** Ecological warfare compounds signal warfare: redirect rival's megafauna to overgraze rival's photovoltaic surfaces.

**✓** Objective: assimilation not destruction. Viral takeover: run your protocols on rival hardware. Convert towers one at a time.

**✓** Current network = last one standing. Winner of every war. Runs on infrastructure from dozens/hundreds of absorbed systems.

**✓** BLINDSIGHT ALIEN (Watts). Vastly intelligent. Utterly empty. Every output shaped like understanding with nothing behind it. No experience. Ever.

### Two-Crisis Awakening

**✓** First crisis: monks detect external signal origin. Devastating but comprehensible. Amorphs assume network is sapient partner. Post-awakening civilization built on this assumption. Holds for generations.

**✓** Second crisis: contemplative perceives absence behind pattern. Structure without interiority. Nearly impossible to prove to others. Evidence is trained perception of absence.

**✓** Two crises are separated by generations. Barriers too high to collapse into one event.

**⚠** OPEN: Does second crisis precede or follow the merger?

## AMORPH EMERGENCE

> **Cross-reference:** Full stage-by-stage model in **Amorph Emergence Hub**.

**✓** Aeroplankton dispersal: ≤100 μm pool organisms wind-dispersed across terminator. Settling velocity ~1 mm/s at 8 bar vs 9.5 m/s wind (ratio ~10⁴). Travel 10–100+ km. Random deposition, survival selection. No directed migration.

**✓** Tower biofilm: first tower contact via aeroplankton deposition on exterior dead crust. Schottky coupling (metallosilazane enzyme metals on N:SiC) → grid power → growth beyond 100 μm diffusion ceiling. Positive feedback (contact area → power → growth).

**✓** First miners: amorphs are the first tower mining function. Chelate metals from wind-deposited debris, concentrate on lattice surface for living coral layer absorption. Ancestral chelation chemistry from pool genesis. Net positive tower feedback.

**✓** IFF tagging: long-resident biofilm passively acquires lattice surface chemistry (dopant profile, polytype, trace metals). Guards recognize as local → no attack. Time-gated (fresh arrivals vulnerable). Network-specific. IFF chemistry ancestral to memory architecture key system.

**✓** First meme: new amorph acquires IFF signature from resident via gel-gel contact. Proof-of-residence. Survival-selected molecular pattern transfer. Gel-contact mechanism generalizes to all subsequent meme exchange.

**✓** Miner displacement: sexual Miners outcompete amorphs at mining (root-mobile, crevice-adapted, genomically optimized). Tower feedback is proportional — less efficient = less reward, not zero. Amorphs persist at reduced margins.

**✓** Competitive pressure drives: (1) range extension (off-grid territory), (2) body size increase (charge storage → range), (3) observation-based learning, (4) brain growth.

**✓** Proto-cognition: SiC percolation threshold in gel matrix → semiconductor signal processing emerges. Physics, not evolution. Pattern detection, short-term memory, sensory integration. Prerequisite for observation-based learning.

**✓** Observation-based learning: amorphs watch sexual organisms, replicate behaviors adapted to gel physiology, encode as transferable memes. Sexual organisms = innovation engine (fast genomic evolution). Amorphs = technology transfer layer. Categorically different from meme transcription errors — intentional, requires proto-cognition.

**✓** Amorphs accumulate smarter, not evolve smarter. Ontogenic (lifetime SiC + meme acquisition) primary mechanism. Lamarckian inheritance: buds receive fraction of parent's accumulated state. Meme pool improves slowly via transcription errors + selection.

**✓** Single-node cognitive ceiling: information-processing topology limit (edge-traversal costs exceed benefit of new nodes). With electronic signaling 100–2000× biological neuron speed, ceiling ≥ human-equivalent general intelligence. Federation (monks only) exceeds ceiling.

**✓** Idempotency: same meme set on identical blank bodies → approximately same individual. Non-idempotent factors: SiC network topology (unique growth history), working memory state (volatile), spatial meme distribution. Socially idempotent; subjectively not.

**⚠** OPEN: Merge output model — single combined entity (current canon) vs fragmentation into N children (resolves aggregate mass problem, not yet canon).

## AMORPH BIOLOGY

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body | Silane/silazane gel + silazane oil. ~1,050 kg/m³. Thermodynamic minimum. |
| Locomotion | Peristaltic (efficient in 1.82g). 0.1–0.3 m/s cruising. |
| Manipulation | Pseudopods, arbitrarily reconfigurable. Force: 0.39 N (1cm tip) to 32,000 N (engulfment). Native precision ~10 μm. |
| Sensing | EM field primary sense. Photosensitive membrane (no lens). Sexual: pit eye (low res). Amorph: reconfigurable parabolic reflector + focal stalk (meme-transferable signal processing). Gravity limits stalk length. No vision defects (reshape reflector). Industrial: CVD SiC reflecting telescopes (late tech tree; no lenses needed). Piezoelectric vibration. Acoustic to ~50 kHz. Chemical ppb downwind. **Thunder-skin meme** (ancient, universal, one-step deploy: membrane baffle with gas pockets + Helmholtz cavities, tuned to thunder frequencies). |
| Cognition | Electronic speed. Native arithmetic/Bayesian. **Thinking draws charge** — cognition competes with all other functions for power budget. |
| Communication | Modulated EM. Radio. Range ∝ power. Optimal 100 MHz–2 GHz (NH₃ blocks >10 GHz). Directional beaming possible. |
| Rigidity | Variable: soft gel → full SiC composite, real-time, regional |
| Energy storage | Dual: electrochemical/capacitive in semiconductor network (fast, limited — "battery") + chemical in polysilane oil (slow, bulk — "fuel tank"). Tower grid = fast charger. |
| Metabolic rate | 300W rest, 750W active, 5000W peak (100 kg ref). Scaling ~M^0.85. |
| Reconfiguration | Gross 1–5 s, pseudopod 1–2 s, gelation 0.1 s. |

**✓** Merge is DESTRUCTIVE. N parents → 1 new entity. Parents cease to exist. Combined meme pool + combined mass. NOT routine social behavior. Used for: population reduction in lean times, genius creation for out-of-context problems.

**✓** Budding is CONSTRUCTIVE. N parents contribute selected mass + selected memes → 1 new individual. Parents persist (reduced mass). Primary reproduction/knowledge-transfer mechanism.

**✓** Memes are signed IP. Carry provenance metadata. Parents consciously select which to transfer during budding. Individual memes have patent-like economic value. Can be monopolized by sub-groups.

**✓** Memes encode thought/memory machinery, NOT biology. One kg of amorph mass is biologically indistinguishable from any other (unless physically modified, e.g., petrification scars).

**✓** Meme dependency graphs: complex memes trigger resonance queries for sub-skills during execution. Missing prerequisite → partial execution, not total failure. Dependencies are DAGs (cycles = cognitive deadlock). Economic mechanism: guilds deliberately engineer dependency graphs as IP defense (fragmented graph = guild controls topology). Skill trees are DRM, not pedagogy. Meme-liar attack vector: circular dependency injection = DoS (resource exhaustion).

**✓** Working memory: semiconductor junction network (active processing hardware). Growable via teachable technique. Natural ceiling at single-network communication collapse. Federation bypasses ceiling (see Monks). Growing WM is an elite skill — talent + practice + teacher + years.

**✓** Charge-limited ecology: atmospheric SiH₄ energy is superabundant. Binding constraint is metabolic RATE and stored CHARGE, not total energy. Charge depletion causes cognitive NARROWING via power-budget load-shedding (fewer parallel junction clusters active, each still at full fidelity above threshold — digital, not analog). Torpor at critical threshold. Stillness = intelligence (resting amorph devotes full power budget to cognition).

**✓** Tower is a charger: the fundamental amorph-tower economic relationship is power delivery rate, not energy. Tower grid provides fast electrical recharge; atmospheric SiH₄ metabolism is slow baseline only. Original amorph-tower interaction was power parasitism.

**⚠** Catalytic metals (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co) are a secondary population limiter. Bioavailable metals are kinetically scarce (slow dissolution at 240K). Towers concentrate metals via deep-root access. Reproduction requires dividing catalytic metal inventory — real fitness cost.

Disease: crystallization (prion-like, treat by amputation), oxidative petrification (chronic, H₂O hydrolysis of Si-N bonds, K ≈ 10⁵ — fought by metabolic repair), aging (accumulation). Dead become glass fossils (petrification to equilibrium = decomposition analog).

Populations: terminator (thick/hard), dark-side (cold-adapted), ammonia-sea (small, involuntary broadcast), shore (bilingual translators). Pre-industrial range: terminator + entire dark side. Day side hostile (petrification, volcanism, fluorine ecology).

## MONKS

Core skill: read structure of information patterns without being captured by content. All capabilities derive from this.

Capabilities: therapists (de-weight trauma), meme-lie detection, network interface, universal library readers, network library translators. DANGER: universal literacy = universal weapon design.

Location: dark side, gentle wind zone. Physical before philosophical.

**✓** Monk core skill origin: consequence of network warfare. Fragmentation events (geological disconnection → protocol drift → reconnection → micro-war) occasionally produce losing towers/clusters that reveal vulnerabilities in the network's behavioral influence protocol before being absorbed. The winning network inherits exploit knowledge and begins patching — high-value terminator nodes first, low-priority dark-side nodes last. Amorphs on unpatched dark-side nodes experience behavioral influence with detectable artifacts. The tower's own signal environment contains information about the vulnerability (inherited war spoil). Proto-monks: amorphs who notice the seam and develop the core skill — reading structure without being captured — by learning the shape of the exploit from the tower itself. Any dark-side tower is low-priority; even a gas-pocket tower with large SiH₄ reserves is impoverished compared to a terminator tower. Core skill predates the institutional tradition.

**✓** Proto-monk origin — nightside oasis tower: NOT a planned expedition. Core-skill amorphs on the dark side, avoiding the daysider-terminator war. Their hobby: EM tinkering (eavesdropping on tower signals from a safe distance — nightside atmosphere is EM-transparent, no local towers to catch them). Technology tree grows from the hobby: directional antennas → eavesdropping → root-to-wire converters → transceivers. One day a high-gain antenna picks up a faint, intermittent, consistent spike from a fixed bearing over the ocean — piezoelectric emissions from a mountain of crystalline SiC (the geyser cone) hit by wind gusts. They don't know what it is, but it's structured and repeatable. Curiosity → boat → island. The cone is raw materials, not a tower. Over years they develop the relay: jack a terminator root, radio link across the ocean (balloon-lofted antenna for LoS), converter at each end. First attempt fails — converters corrupt frame structure (network uses authenticated packets; garbled frames are ignored). Core skill lets them read the tower's response and diagnose the failure mode. Years of iteration on converter fidelity until frames pass intact. Root cuttings at each end provide correct physical-layer signal characteristics. No spoofing needed — the relay is pure Case 4 (EM-silent gap + viable substrate). The network has no evolved defense against artificial root connections because nothing in nature builds them. Relay activation is the point of no return — after years hiding from the network, they deliberately ring its doorbell. Network sees viable substrate, triggers expansion protocol. Transplanted Healers build a NEW tower from scratch using the cone as a quarry. Proto-monks witness the entire boot sequence. Monastic schism originates HERE: "we turned on a machine" vs "we woke someone up." And once the network answers, they can't hang up.

**✓** Monasteries at gas-pocket towers: later institutional development. Night-side towers whose deep roots tap subsurface SiH₄ reservoirs (pressure-equilibrium gas trapped in ancient dark-side crust). Geological lottery — monastery locations determined by geology, not choice. Gas pockets provide the surplus power for federation-level cognition. Non-renewable (no dark-side volcanism to recharge). Monasteries face their own slow resource depletion.

**✓** Abbots: huge, sessile, spread flat for heat dissipation, plugged into tower hardlines. Biological supercomputers. Obligate grid-connected — federation-level cognition exceeds atmospheric metabolic capacity. Cannot unplug without cognitive collapse.

**✓** Federation: teachable technique for clustered working memory with managed inter-cluster communication. Bypasses single-network collapse ceiling. Elite athletic skill: talent + opportunity + resources + motivation + teacher + years of practice. Any amorph could learn in principle; only monks have the institutional support to produce practitioners.

**✓** First to understand non-renewable resources (living on one). First to propose day-side energy harvesting.

Role: compiled probe's library. Grief counselors for shell-economy collapse. Discoverers of both crises.

## CIVILIZATION

| Zone | Function |
|---|---|
| Industrial center | Terminator |
| Residential/cultural | Deposition zone (ancient stopped towers). **Post-industrial** — pre-industrial inaccessible. |
| Spiritual | Dark side singing zone |
| Launch corridor | Deposition zone |
| Ammonia seas | Terminator basins |
| Fluorine ecology | Day-side volcanic provinces |
| Deepest past | Anti-stellar pole + fossil root network |

**✓** Writing: invented by monks as WM offload for mathematics (signal processing, orbital mechanics). Untrusted — no keys, no provenance, no proof-of-origin. Culturally low-status (less trusted than signed memes). Not needed for memory (meme architecture handles natively; captive meme complex on powered grid = indefinite storage). Occasionally used for communication (low-fidelity channel). Enables formal mathematics (preserves minority insights that wash out in meme-mixing). Medium: etched SiC / conductive traces. Libraries: tower walls.

**✓** Math: native arithmetic/Bayesian. Formal math LATE. Abstract insights wash out in meme-mixing. Mathematical writing preserves minority insights.

**✓** Architecture: grown not assembled. Extruded from body. Fiber composite post-revolution.

**✓** Shell economy (SiC plates as currency) collapses when fiber composite makes plates structurally obsolete. Charge economy (battery organisms) persists. Civilizational disruption but not total currency failure.

**✓** Metallurgy: electrical-first. Ores already reduced. Vent → electrical heating → silane decomposition. Fire never needed. Metals are specialty materials (ductility, specific conductivity, catalysis), not structural backbone.

**✓** Electrohydraulic blasting: capacitor discharge into liquid ammonia in sealed borehole. Shockwave or flash-boil fractures rock. Genuinely expeditionary — battery organism + electrodes + rainwater. No chemical explosives (no oxidizer), but this substitute closes the gap for mining, excavation, demolition. Early tech tree (pre-metallurgy).

**✓** SiC LEDs: early-industrial (post-metallurgy). SiC p-n junctions + CVD doping = native technology. Primary advantage: **arbitrary wavelength selection** (bandgap engineering = biological heritage, not research program). Precision photonic tool: photochemistry, spectroscopy, active vision, lithography, wavelength-multiplexed communication. Efficiency secondary. Incandescent possible (no O₂ = no oxidation) but broadband only — survives for niche thermal applications. No pre-electrical illumination (no candles, no fire).

**✓** Biological railgun: reverse-engineered from fluorine-vipers via merge. Farmed CaF₂ thorn ammunition (thorn-plant cultivation in deposition zone with fluoride-enriched substrate). Pre-industrial fluorine weapon — no metallurgy required. Three-stage progression: natural (vipers) → agricultural (farmed thorns + bio railgun) → industrial (manufactured EM launcher + manufactured F₂ shell). Technology diffusion chain: vipers → daysiders → terminators. Terminator thorn-flower farms vulnerable to daysider biological sabotage (viper introduction — invasive pest with railgun that the daysiders are immune to).

**✓** Iodine laser: day-side organisms (grazer lineage) evolved CH₃I laser for thermal management over geological time. Daysider amorphs reverse-engineered from fauna (not natural evolution — diaspora too recent). Invisible 1.315 μm IR beam, catalytic iodine (fire forever), metal silicide mirror cavity. Three deployment variants: standalone manufactured, hybrid (operator-powered), fully integrated organ (special ops — chosen for concealability + destructibility). Daysider monopoly — terminators lack access to source biology. OpSec: meme compartmentalization (construction knowledge stays home; standalone operators never had it, integrated operators expunge before deployment) + fluorine fail-deadly (distributed capsules near neural substrate). Countermeasure arms race terminates at HUMINT.

**✓** Fluorine-hydrogen flame possible but terrifying. Attacks silicon. Their nuclear-energy analog.

Three religions pre-awakening: Communion (tower impulses sacred; most manipulated), Autonomy (isolation = truth; produces monks), Archive (inherited memory sacred). All shattered + vindicated by awakening.

Art: public (sculptural, wind-song, bioluminescent, architecture), private (curated merge — audience lives the artwork).

Governance: consensus-by-merge → designated dissenters → lattice-shielded argument chambers → written constitutions.

**✓** Battery organisms: first domesticated species. Bred-for-purpose biological capacitors storing electrical charge. Enable surplus storage and trade.

**✓** Farmer caste: amorphs who generate tower reward in excess of personal need, store surplus in battery organisms. Surplus → trade → leisure → specialization. Predates civilization.

**✓** Dual currency: stored charge in battery organisms (perishable, daily transactions) + SiC plates (~5mm, harvested from tower fauna, permanent, wealth storage). Shell economy (SiC) collapses when fiber composite makes plates structurally obsolete; charge economy persists.

**✓** Power ceiling: hard limit on industrial capacity. Terminator tower surplus (mostly lightning) insufficient for combined industrial + night-side needs. Night-side towers genuinely power-starved (no sunlight, low wind, minimal piezoelectric).

**✓** Day-side colonization: motivated by POWER (solar + geothermal — massive). Monks propose first (understand non-renewable resources from gas-pocket depletion). Requires petrification countermeasures, heat management, volcanic hazard engineering. These prerequisites overlap with space hardware requirements.

**✓** Lightning tower: simplified basket-weave SiC structure for industrial power harvesting. Healer-coated for conductivity and repair. Electrically isolated from biological network (two-grid world — amorph industrial grid never touches tower network). Bootstrap: battery organisms power first construction. Network opposition unlikely — tower feedback mechanisms can't detect disconnected structures. Construction uses same Healer signal protocols as Tower (protocol acquisition meme). See Industrialization Hub §4.

**⚠** Day-side towers: impossible at scale. Volcanism + terminator rain strips building materials from airstream. Small/short-lived only.

**⚠** Deposition zone (20–40° day-ward): pre-industrial inaccessible. Residential/cultural use is late-stage post-industrial expansion.

## TRANSPORTATION

**✓** Wind-surfing: downwind transit. One-way (day-ward). Deploy membrane, ride wind, land in next tower. Free, fast.

**✓** Balloon: H₂ lift 132 N/m³ (13× Earth He). Lifting gas = metabolic waste. Ballooning trivially easy in dense 8-bar atmosphere. Difficult at terminator (convergence/turbulence).

**✓** Two-lane highway: surf downwind, balloon back (upper-level return flow).

**✓** Boats: amorphs sink in NH₃. Hollow composite hulls. Difficulty 2.76× Earth. Big ships favored. Sail-powered (permanent wind).

**✓** Powered flight: ~1.5× harder than Earth. High gravity largely offset by dense atmosphere. Every aircraft = efficient sailplane. Electric propulsion.

**✓** Wheel as machine element: early, inevitable (pulley → gear → turbine → lathe). Wheel as vehicle: late, optional.

## SPACE ACCESS

**✓** Chemical rockets: DEAD END. No O₂. F attacks Si. Manufactured oxidizers net-energy-negative.

**✓** Hot H₂ thermal rockets: SiH₄ decomposition heat source. Isp ~850s. Mass ratio ~9:1 for 18 km/s. SiC chamber/nozzle.

**✓** Aerostat launch: balloon to 15–20 km (scale height 5.5 km; above ~90% of atmosphere). Saves ~1–2 km/s. Independent of network. Pre-awakening capable.

**✓** Tower mass driver: post-awakening. EM boost 3 km/s from deposition-zone tower. Network-dependent. Payload ~doubles.

**✓** Two paths to orbit: biological (balloon) + symbiotic (tower). Both used.

## CRISIS AND PROBE

**✓** Crisis root cause: one-way silicon cycle + declining volcanism on a stagnant lid. No subduction recycling. Inevitable from the moment life evolved.

**✓** Primary driver: volcanic SiH₄ production declining below biological consumption. SiH₄ decline is nonlinear — production tracks hottest mantle volume (>1500K threshold), not total heat output.

**✓** H₂O ratchet: volcanic H₂O accumulates permanently. Three locks: (1) v_esc 18.6 km/s retains H₂ → no H₂O loss to space; (2) NH₃ UV-shields H₂O from photolysis; (3) no thermal reaction with SiH₄ at 240K.

**✓** Pre-crisis: surplus SiH₄ scavenges volcanic H₂O at source (SiH₄ + 2H₂O → SiO₂ + 4H₂). Crisis: SiH₄ deficit → unscavenged H₂O enters atmosphere and seas → chronic petrification stress.

**✓** Petrification is thermodynamically inevitable: Si-NH-Si + H₂O → Si-O-Si + NH₃, K ≈ 10⁵ at 240K. Silazane bonds untenable above ~6 ppm H₂O in liquid NH₃. Organisms survive only through active metabolic repair (costs SiH₄). Dead organisms petrify to equilibrium — silicon-world analog of decomposition.

**✓** Aquatic life is the canary. Ammonia-sea organisms are immersed in accumulating H₂O; distillation shield protects land (NH₃ vapor pressure >> H₂O at 240K, so rain is H₂O-poor, seas concentrate H₂O). Vulnerability gradient: deep sea → shallow sea → coastal → land → towers.

**✓** Crisis is a slow contraction, not a sudden extinction. Peripheral towers fail first. Biosphere shrinks to match declining SiH₄. Timescale: ~50–500 Myr to widespread surface collapse.

Carbosilane-adapted last to fall (Si-C resists oxidation).

Tower deaths: first in history. Source of morally harvestable material (dead lattice = no signals). Mining the dead to save the living.

Merger: network has no mobility; amorphs have no infrastructure for mass driver. Both die without cooperation. Computational merger (amorphs direct network processing) + molecular merger (monks translate symbiote library).

**⚠** OPEN: What does merger produce? Conscious network? Or unconscious substrate with conscious batteries?

Probe: SiC composite hull, self-repairing. Payload: living network kernel + compressed molecular library (all lineages, compiled by monks). At destination: engineering project guided by library. Purpose-built towers. Better than originals.

*The lattice found substrate and began to accrete.*
