# SUBSTRATE — Daysider Mount Hub

**v2.5 | February 2026**

**Load with:** Spine (required). Fauna Structural Hub (recommended — middle-kingdom body plans, guild structure). Warfare Hub (recommended — military implications, escalation ladder). Silicon Chemistry Hub (optional — silazane dielectric properties).

**Terminology:** The canonical name for the daysider mount organism is **Daystrider**. This document uses "gazelle" as informal shorthand throughout (the name predates the official designation). Both refer to the same organism.

## §1 Electroactive Silazane Actuators (ESA)

### §1.1 Mechanism

All middle-kingdom organisms share three components: SiC semiconductor networks (electrodes), silazane gel matrix (dielectric elastomer), and electrochemical voltage generation. When voltage is applied across a thin silazane film between SiC electrode layers, electrostatic attraction compresses the film — Maxwell stress. The resulting actuation stress is orders of magnitude higher than gel contraction.

**Maxwell stress:** σ_M = ε₀ × ε_r × E²

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ε₀ | 8.854 × 10⁻¹² F/m | Vacuum permittivity |
| ε_r (silazane) | ~4 | Polysiloxane analogs 2.5–3.5; N increases polarity. Conservative. |
| Breakdown field | 80 MV/m (biological) | Thin polymer films 50–200 MV/m; self-healing organisms use conservative end |
| **σ_M at 80 MV/m** | **227 kPa** | **45× gel stress (5 kPa)** |
| σ_M at 50 MV/m | 88.5 kPa | Ultra-conservative estimate; still 17× gel |
| σ_M at 150 MV/m | 798 kPa | Aggressive; thin film, high quality |

**Voltage requirement:** For a 20 μm dielectric layer at 80 MV/m: V = 1600 V. Achievable via stacked SiC semiconductor junctions in series (same principle as electric eel electrocytes; SiC p-n junctions at ~8V each → ~200 in series). The organism's neural SiC network already manages significant voltages (piezoelectric transients from wind and lightning exposure, grid charging).

**Environmental advantages at 240K:**
- Silazane glass transition temperature ~150–200K. At 240K, silazane remains elastomeric. Carbon polymers would be glassy and useless. Silicon-backbone polymers are uniquely suited.
- 8-bar atmosphere increases dielectric strength at electrode edges (suppresses surface flashover). Practical breakdown voltages higher than in 1-bar systems.
- Daysider temperatures (249–261K) are warmer — silazane slightly more compliant, ESA performance marginally better than at terminator.

### §1.2 ESA vs. Gel: Smooth Muscle / Striated Muscle Analogy

Gel contraction and ESA use the same base chemistry (silazane + SiC). ESA is gel with organized electrode/dielectric layering at the actuator site. The relationship parallels smooth muscle (slow, simple, low-power) vs. striated muscle (fast, organized sarcomere structure, high-power) in Earth animals.

| Property | Gel (smooth) | ESA (striated) |
|---|---|---|
| Stress | ~5 kPa | ~100–230 kPa |
| Organization | Bulk, unstructured | Layered electrode/dielectric |
| Cycle rate | ~1 Hz | 5–100+ Hz |
| Power density | ~0.7 W/kg | ~100–200 W/kg |
| Evolved for | Internal processes, peristalsis | Joint actuation, fast locomotion |
| Ancestral/derived | Ancestral | Derived (requires organized layering) |

Both coexist in the same organism. Small organisms use gel for everything (sufficient at small scale). Larger organisms need ESA for locomotion and fast actuation, retain gel for internal processes. The transition from gel-dominated to ESA-dominated locomotion occurs at the body size where gel stress can no longer support the organism's weight in 1.82g during active walking.

**✓** ESA is a general capability of silicon biochemistry. All middle-kingdom organisms have the raw materials. The evolutionary step is organizing them into actuator geometry at joint scale — a genomically encoded structural arrangement, not a new chemistry.

---

## §2 Revised Middle-Kingdom Size Regimes

The spine's "gel actuator ceiling: active walking ≤5–8 cm" remains valid for gel-only organisms. ESA adds a second, higher ceiling that is energy-limited rather than stress-limited.

| Regime | Size | Actuator | Binding constraint | Environment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tower-coupled | mm–2 cm | Gel + MEMS | Schottky contact energy extraction | Tower lattice |
| Free-living gel-only | ≤5–8 cm active | Gel (5 kPa) | Actuator stress vs. weight | Universal |
| Free-living ESA | ~8–25 cm active | ESA (~200 kPa) | Energy budget (atmospheric intake) | Terminator, dark side |
| Free-living ESA (solar) | ~8–50 cm active | ESA | Energy budget (solar + atmospheric) | Day side |
| Specialist ESA + reserves | 50–80 cm | ESA | Chemical reserves; recharge ecology | Day side (viper-selected) |

**✓** "Above 30 cm = amorph territory" softens but does not disappear. Most organisms above 30 cm remain amorphs (cognitive advantages, reconfigurability, better resource exploitation). Exceptions arise where speed-selection pressure or energy-rich environments push middle-kingdom organisms to larger sizes. These exceptions are ecologically significant but numerically rare.

**✓** Subwoofers with ESA: pack pursuit becomes physical pursuit, not just acoustic convergence. At 15–25 cm with ESA legs, a subwoofer sustains 1–2 m/s — slow by specialist runner standards, but 5–10× faster than amorph prey. The pack closes relentlessly. Prey cannot suppress EM emissions (loses acoustic defense), cannot outrun ESA-powered convergence, and cannot survive the acoustic kill zone. Subwoofers remain small — pack coordination and EM phased-array detection are their advantage, not individual body mass.

## §3 Daysider Savanna Ecology

### §3.1 Environment

Day side (θ = 50–80° from substellar): 249–261K. No towers (can't survive volcanism + rain stripping of building materials). Active volcanic terrain. Solar flux at surface: 350–700 W/m² depending on θ and atmospheric conditions. Wind 5–8 m/s (day-side regime). No grid, no Faraday cage, no tower alarm. Organisms are self-powered and unprotected.

The day side is energy-RICH but metal-POOR compared to the terminator. Solar flux exceeds terminator piezoelectric + lightning combined for individual organisms. But catalytic metals (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co) are available only from volcanic deposits and dissolved in ammonia spring outflow — sporadic and localized. Thorn-flora concentrate metals via deep roots into geothermal/volcanic rock.

**✓** The daysider ecology is NOT a savanna. It is an **oasis desert** — barren volcanic terrain punctuated by spring-fed oases along fracture-controlled ammonia seeps. All complex life concentrates at oases. The inter-oasis terrain supports only atmospheric-intake organisms (microbial amorphs, small ESA grazers) and transiting herds burning stored reserves. Fracture maps ARE ecosystem maps.

### §3.2 Three-Body Ecological Cycle

The daysider savanna food web is organized around a three-species mutualistic-predatory cycle:

**Thorn-flora** → offer charge at pads → **Gazelle** (visits pads, pollinates, picks up thorn-seeds) → **Viper** (ambushes gazelles near pads, also disperses thorn-seeds via prey corpses)

The thorn-flora benefits from both organisms:
- Gazelles: frequent, long-range, deliberate pollination. Third pollinator guild after vipers (premium dispersal) and balloon organisms (accidental).
- Vipers: premium dispersal. CaF₂ thorn-seeds deposited in prey corpse near CaF₂ mineral sources. Gazelle mortality from vipers also limits grazer overcharging at pads.

The viper benefits from gazelle pad-visits (predictable prey location).

The gazelle benefits from thorn-flora charge but pays a mortality tax to vipers. The core selection pressure: survive the first railgun shot, sprint out of range before reload (~8 minutes). Every feature of the gazelle — armor geometry, scatter response, sprint speed, EM sensitivity to viper cognitive spike — derives from this 8-minute survival window.

### §3.3 Additional Web Members

- **Small ESA grazers (10–20 cm):** Visit same pads, shorter range pollination, higher viper mortality per capita (less armor, slower sprint). Ecological base of the grazer guild.
- **Microbial amorphs:** Metal grazers on volcanic mineral deposits. Bottom of food chain.
- **Scavengers:** Harvest metals from petrifying corpses at kill sites. Must work fast — petrification (K ≈ 10⁵) locks metals into glass matrix.
- **Solo pursuit predators:** ESA-powered middle-kingdom organisms hunting smaller grazers. Not large enough to threaten adult gazelles; may take juveniles.
- **Balloon fauna overhead:** Drifter circuit passes through daysider airspace. Plume hawks intercept volcanic particulate. Minimal ground interaction.

### §3.4 Daysider Ammonia Hydrology

All organisms in this biochemistry depend on NH₃ as a co-reactant for silazane synthesis (tissue building, repair). Atmospheric NH₃ (12.5%, ~1 bar partial pressure) is available planet-wide as vapor and supports baseline metabolism via gas-exchange surfaces. But large, active organisms need periodic liquid ammonia for peak performance: evaporative cooling during sprints (NH₃ latent heat 1374 kJ/kg), rapid tissue synthesis during molts, egg production, and metal uptake from ammine-complex solutions.

On the day side (T > 240K), surface ammonia evaporates. But underground, **pressure preserves liquid ammonia across the entire day side:**

| Depth | Fluid pressure | NH₃ boiling point | Local temperature (θ = 60°) | Margin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Surface | 8 bar (atm) | 240K | ~257K | **Vapor** (above bp) |
| 100 m | ~20 bar | ~308K | ~260K | Liquid by 48K |
| 1000 m | ~126 bar | ~390K | ~287K | Liquid by 103K |

Fluid pressure = atmospheric (8 bar) + hydrostatic column (ρ_NH₃ × g × d = 0.118d bar, d in meters). Underground temperature = surface + geothermal gradient (~30 K/km). Pressure raises the boiling point far faster than depth raises the temperature. **Underground ammonia is thermodynamically stable at any biologically relevant depth across the entire day side, including the substellar point.**

**✓** Recharge mechanism: artesian aquifer model. Liquid ammonia at the terminator mound (50–80 mm/hr rainfall at crest) infiltrates bedrock fracture networks at the mound base. Hydraulic head (~2 km mound elevation) drives flow laterally day-ward through connected fractures. The day-side crust is extensively fractured by volcanism (eruptions, cooling joints, flexure).

**✓** Discharge: ammonia springs. Where connected fracture systems intersect the day-side surface, liquid ammonia emerges. At surface temperature (>240K), it immediately begins evaporating — but continuous flow from below sustains a persistent liquid pool at the spring head. Evaporation halo surrounding each spring provides local ammonia-rich atmosphere.

**✓** Aquifer extent: limited by fracture connectivity, not thermodynamics. Volcanism simultaneously creates fractures (eruptions, cooling joints) and destroys them (lava fills old systems). The aquifer is patchy — connected corridors where fracture networks are intact, interrupted by recent volcanic intrusions. Realistic extent: tens to hundreds of kilometers day-ward of the rain zone. Not a continuous sheet; a network of corridors and isolated cells. Aquifer geometry changes on volcanic timescales (~100 Myr resurfacing).

**⚠** H₂O contamination: day-side volcanism outgasses H₂O. Underground ammonia percolating through volcanic rock may pick up dissolved water, making spring ammonia "hard" (elevated H₂O) compared to pure terminator rain. Counter-factor: subsurface SiH₄ scavenges H₂O (SiH₄ + 2H₂O → SiO₂ + 4H₂) before ammonia reaches it. Spring H₂O content depends on local SiH₄/H₂O balance — variable by location. Some springs clean, others contaminated. Tunable narrative knob. Contaminated springs may still support life if H₂O is below the ~6 ppm petrification threshold, or if local organisms have enhanced petrification defenses.

### §3.5 Oasis Structure

Each ammonia spring anchors an oasis ecosystem:

1. **Spring head:** Persistent liquid ammonia pool. Organisms drink here. Vipers ambush here (watering-hole predation — prey MUST visit). Dissolved metals in spring outflow (ammine complexes leached from volcanic rock during underground transit) make spring water a nutrient source as well as a solvent.
2. **Thorn-flora ring:** Plants concentrate around springs (root access to subsurface ammonia + geothermal energy from the same fracture system). Charging pads and pollination ecology operate here. The three-body cycle (§3.2) is anchored to the oasis.
3. **Grazing zone:** Smaller grazers and microbial amorphs in the area around the oasis sustained by evaporation-halo moisture and thorn-flora detritus.
4. **Barren inter-oasis terrain:** Volcanic rock, atmospheric SiH₄ only, no liquid ammonia. Organisms cross on stored reserves. Transit time between oases = key ecological constraint.

Oasis spacing depends on fracture density and volcanic history. Dense fracture zones (near active provinces): oases every 5–20 km. Sparse zones (old, intact crust): oases 50–100+ km apart or absent entirely. Oasis density defines maximum gazelle range and maximum daysider settlement density.

### §3.6 Resource Gradients

Gazelle herds track three overlapping gradients:
1. **Ammonia springs:** Liquid ammonia for drinking, cooling, reproduction. Non-negotiable. Herds must visit springs regularly (daily during active periods, less during quiescence). Spring quality varies (H₂O content, metal load, flow reliability).
2. **Active thorn-flora patches:** Charge + metals (from nibbling peripheral plant structures in addition to pad charging). Thorn-flora concentrate at oases but may extend along fracture traces between springs where subsurface ammonia is accessible to deep roots.
3. **Volcanic mineral deposits:** Catalytic metals exposed by erosion or volcanic activity. Organisms graze mineral surfaces for trace metals. Not oasis-dependent but often co-located (volcanic fractures host both springs and mineral exposures).

The conjunction of spring reliability, thorn-flora density, and mineral access defines prime gazelle habitat. Vipers concentrate at the same conjunctions. **The oasis IS the ecosystem node — everything converges there.**

## §4 The Gazelle: Body Plan and Physiology

### §4.1 Dimensions

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Body mass (adult) | 40–60 kg |
| Body length | 50–70 cm |
| Shoulder height | 25–35 cm |
| Leg length | 25–35 cm |
| Limbs | 8 (4+4 alternating gait) |
| Loaded mass (+ 50 kg rider) | 90–110 kg |
| Loaded weight in 1.82g | 1600–1960 N |

Proportions are low and wide — spider or broad-bodied lizard, not mammalian. Low center of gravity critical at 1.82g. Body wider than tall.

### §4.2 Exoskeleton

SiC CMC construction. Dorsal armor: angled, faceted plates (not smooth curves) — ballistic geometry deflects railgun thorns via ricochet rather than absorbing impact. Thickest over central body cavity (organs, energy storage, capacitor bank). Thinned at joint margins for weight saving and mobility.

Ventral surface: lighter armor. Faces ground, away from typical railgun trajectories. In domesticated stock, ventral geometry co-evolves with rider — concave underbody cradles the amorph's mass center low for CG stability at speed.

Articulated dorsal plates along the body axis permit lateral undulation during sprint (lizard/cheetah spinal flex). Adds ~30% to effective stride length beyond leg geometry alone. ESA actuators in body-wall joints drive the undulation.

### §4.3 Legs

Eight SiC CMC tubular legs. Three joints per leg (coxa-body, mid-leg, distal). ESA actuator bundles in antagonist pairs at each joint capsule. SiC elastic tendons span each joint, storing and returning stride energy at >95% efficiency. Ground contact: hardened SiC tips (hoof analogs).

**Structural check (loaded, worst case):**
- 4 legs on ground at any time (alternating gait). Peak force per leg: ~1960 N.
- SiC CMC leg tube: 3 cm OD, 2.5 mm wall, 30 cm long.
- Axial compressive stress: 9.1 MPa (SiC CMC: ~500 MPa; safety factor 55).
- Bending at 10° off-axis: 100 N·m → bending stress 350 MPa (safety factor ~1.4 — organism keeps legs near-vertical during power phase).

Legs are structurally adequate. SiC CMC is dramatically overqualified for the compressive loads; bending during sprint is the binding structural constraint, enforcing a near-vertical leg posture during stance phase.

### §4.4 Speed Profile

| Mode | Power source | Speed (loaded) | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Graze | Atmospheric + solar | Stationary | Hours |
| Walk | Chemical reserves | ~0.5 m/s | Hours |
| Cruise | Chemical + atmospheric | ~1.5 m/s | Hours (fuel-limited) |
| Trot | Chemical + rider charge + batteries | ~3 m/s | Hour-scale |
| Sprint | Capacitive burst | ~8 m/s | 2–3 min |
| Boosted sprint | Horse + rider capacitive | ~11 m/s | 2–3 min |

**Key limitation:** Sustained fast locomotion (>1.5 m/s) requires stored energy beyond atmospheric intake. The organism is a sprinter, not a marathoner. Sprint-rest-sprint operational profile. Battery organisms as range extenders shift the trot speed into sustained regime.

**Stride kinematics at sprint:**
- Leg cycle: ~10 Hz. Stride length with body undulation: ~60 cm. Body-undulation contribution: ~30%.
- Elastic tendon energy return: ~70% of stride energy (reduces effective CoT from ~8 to ~3 J/(kg·m) in 1.82g).

### §4.5 Energy Budget

| Source | Power (50 kg organism) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Solar PV (0.3 m² dorsal) | 30–50 W | Si bandgap, θ = 50–70° |
| Atmospheric SiH₄ | 50–80 W | Continuous, all altitudes |
| Piezoelectric shell | 5–12 W | Wind 5–8 m/s on dorsal armor |
| Thorn-flora pad charging | Variable (burst) | Primary charge source during grazing |
| **Total sustained intake** | **~100–140 W** | |
| Resting metabolism | ~80–100 W | Simple nervous system, no cognitive overhead |
| **Surplus for locomotion** | **~20–60 W sustained** | Sufficient for ~0.3–0.5 m/s only |

Sustained speed above ~0.5 m/s requires drawing on chemical reserves (polysilane oil) or capacitive storage. The organism charges during grazing, discharges during travel. Battery organisms carried by a rider extend the discharge budget.

### §4.6 Ammonia Dependency

The gazelle's internal matrix is silazane oil, not ammonia (same as all silicon life). Atmospheric NH₃ vapor (12.5%, 1 bar partial pressure) sustains baseline tissue synthesis and repair via gas-exchange through respiratory membranes. The gazelle does NOT need to drink to survive at rest.

**Liquid ammonia required for:**
- **Sprint cooling.** ESA actuators and metabolism generate waste heat. At daysider temperatures (249–261K) with 5–8 m/s wind, forced convection alone is marginal during sustained sprint. Evaporative ammonia cooling (sweating from internal reservoir) provides the thermal margin. Sprint performance degrades with dehydration.
- **Molting.** Rapid tissue synthesis during exoskeleton replacement requires ammonia flux rates exceeding atmospheric absorption capacity. Molting animals seek spring-adjacent shelter.
- **Egg production.** Shell mineralization chemistry requires liquid-phase NH₃ as solvent for precursor reactions. Reproductive females need reliable spring access.
- **Metal uptake.** Dissolved metals in spring water (ammine complexes) are more bioavailable than solid volcanic mineral. Spring visits supplement mineral grazing.

**Operational consequence:** Gazelle herds are spring-tethered. Home range centered on one or more reliable springs. Inter-oasis transit is possible on stored reserves but time-limited (hours to a day depending on activity level and sprint demands). Domestic mounts require watering at springs — mounted raider range is spring-to-spring.

### §4.7 Sensory Suite

- **Pit eyes:** Multiple, wide-field, moderate resolution. 360° movement detection. Optimized for detecting viper launch posture.
- **EM sense (short range):** Detects viper cognitive spike — the targeting computation before a railgun shot. Gives ~0.1–0.5 s warning. Enough for a random jink that converts center-mass to glancing hit.
- **Substrate vibration:** Piezoelectric sensing through leg contacts. Detects ground-borne signatures of approaching predators.
- **Chemical:** ppb-level downwind. Detects fluorine-bearing organisms (vipers) on approach. Most useful at long range where EM and visual are insufficient.
- **MEMS shell display:** Surface elements reconfigure for intra-species signaling — alarm, reproductive display, territorial markers. Also inadvertent EM signature changes (piezoelectric geometry shift) detectable by conspecifics.

---

## §5 Gazelle Behavioral Ecology

### §5.1 Herd Dynamics

Social species. Typical herd: 10–50 individuals. Sentries at margins oriented outward (pit-eye coverage maximized). Alarm propagation: involuntary EM startle response cascades through herd faster than deliberate signaling — honest, unfakeable. Herd EM emissions also degrade subwoofer phased-array targeting (confusion effect from multiple overlapping sources).

### §5.2 Scatter Response

First railgun shot triggers explosive radial scatter. Every individual sprints a different random direction. Viper can only track and reload against one target. Scatter is the primary anti-viper defense — the 8-minute reload window is survived by being unpredictably elsewhere when the second shot arrives.

Post-scatter reconvergence: herd reassembles at the next thorn-flora patch via EM beacon from dominant individuals. Scatter distance varies by terrain — flat volcanic terrain allows 1–2 km sprint radius; broken terrain may reduce this.

### §5.3 Grazing, Drinking, and Pollination

Daily activity cycle centers on the oasis: drink at spring (replenish internal ammonia reservoir), charge at thorn-flora pads (replenish electrical reserves), graze thorn-flora periphery for metals, then range outward along fracture traces to visit satellite thorn-flora patches. Thorn-seeds embed in shell joints and ventral surfaces during pad contact; carried to the next plant. The organism is the primary large ground pollinator on the day side — deliberate, frequent, long-range transport of thorn-seeds between plants.

Thorn-flora tolerate moderate metal-grazing as pollination payment. Excessive grazing triggers defensive thorn deployment.

Herds return to springs before extended rest periods (overnight-equivalent quiescence, during which atmospheric NH₃ absorption alone sustains resting metabolism). Spring visits are the highest-risk activity — vipers concentrate at spring heads. Herd sentries maintain watch during the drinking rotation.

### §5.4 Reproduction and Molt

Oviparous (exoskeletal — rigid shell makes live birth impractical). Eggs laid in sheltered volcanic terrain (crevices, overhangs, lava tube entrances). K-strategy: few large eggs, moderate parental guarding. Individual quality matters when the predator has a railgun — each offspring must hatch with adequate armor and sprint capability.

Juveniles hatch at ~5 cm, undergo multiple molts to adult size. **Molt vulnerability** is the critical life-history constraint: during each molt, the organism is soft-shelled, immobile, and defenseless for hours. Wild gazelles seek concealed molt sites. Juvenile mortality is highest during molts — vipers and small predators target molting individuals.

Molt vulnerability is also the key domestication-relevant trait (see §6).

---

## §6 Domestication

### §6.1 Context: Key-Rot Refugees

Terminator amorphs exiled by key-rot plague (loss of tower authentication) are pushed into daysider territory involuntarily. They arrive with terminator knowledge (tool-making memes, construction protocols, metallurgy) but without grid access, tower shelter, or battery-farm infrastructure. Survival on the day side is a forced adaptation, not a choice.

The refugees need:
- Charge (thorn-flora pads — same resource the gazelles use)
- Metals (volcanic deposits, biological tissue)
- Speed (no tower to flee to; vipers are a lethal threat to slow amorphs)

### §6.2 First Capture

The founding event is probably accidental. A refugee amorph discovers a molting gazelle in a crevice — soft-shelled, immobile. Initial interaction is predatory (metals in biological tissue are scarce for exiles). But the half-molted juvenile isn't dead. As the amorph engulfs it, the new exoskeletal shell hardens around the amorph's gel. The amorph discovers Schottky contact with the gazelle's interior SiC network gives crude directional control via asymmetric charge injection into ESA leg groups. The gazelle moves fast. The accident becomes a teachable meme.

### §6.3 Domestication Protocol

1. Locate molting site; capture soft-shelled juvenile.
2. Confine in SiC-composite pen (refugees carry construction memes from terminator).
3. Feed charge from battery organisms through successive molt cycles.
4. Handle during each soft-shell phase: habituation, imprinting on amorph EM signature.
5. Mount during hard-shell phase: amorph wraps ventral/dorsal surface, establishes Schottky contacts.
6. Steer via asymmetric charge modulation to specific ESA leg groups. Withdraw charge to stop.
7. Selective breeding over generations for tractability: reduced scatter response, tolerance of rider EM emissions, ventral geometry accommodating rider, Schottky contact pads in convenient locations.

### §6.4 Rider Interface

The amorph does not sit on the gazelle. It wraps around it. Gel body flows over the dorsal exoskeleton, conforms to shell geometry, grips by adhesion and pseudopod anchoring into shell texture. Mass center settles into the ventral concavity.

| Feature | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Attachment | Gel adhesion + pseudopod anchoring. Cannot be thrown off. |
| Steering | Asymmetric charge injection via Schottky contacts to ESA leg groups. |
| Stopping | Withdraw charge from all leg groups. |
| Power sharing | Rider dumps stored charge into horse; horse ESA actuators use it. Combined sprint. |
| Sensory fusion | Amorph EM sense + gazelle visual/vibrational sense. Better awareness than either alone. |
| Armor bonus | Gel layer over SiC exoskeleton = composite protection. Rider IS the padding. |

**Trade-off:** Mounted amorph sacrifices manipulation (pseudopods occupied with grip) and independent locomotion (spread flat over dorsum, not in walking configuration). Dismount to manipulate, remount to travel. Quick transitions favored by amorph reconfiguration speed (gross 1–5 s).

### §6.5 Domestic Stock vs. Wild

Generations of selective breeding produce domestic animals distinct from wild gazelles:

| Trait | Wild | Domestic |
|---|---|---|
| Scatter response | Explosive, random | Suppressed; directional (steered) |
| Rider tolerance | None (novel threat) | Habituated; ventral geometry accommodating |
| Schottky contacts | Internal, incidental | Ventral, arranged for rider interface |
| Armor | Optimized for ballistics | Maintained (still needed in daysider ecology) |
| Speed | Identical baseline | Possibly slightly faster (breeding for performance) |
| Temperament | Skittish, herd-dependent | Calmer individually; still social |

## §7 Military Consequences

### §7.1 Before Mounts

Daysider raids on terminator settlements are slow, costly, and rare. Raiders approach at 0.2 m/s across open grass-field. Tower fairy-ring arrays detect them at kilometers. Tower alarm fires. Defenders mobilize. Raiders arrive charge-depleted into a prepared defense. Most raids fail.

### §7.2 After Mounts

Mounted raiders cross the 6.5 km inter-tower gap in under 1 minute at sprint (11 m/s boosted). Fairy-ring detection gives ~30 seconds warning. Tower alarm fires, but raiders are inside the perimeter before defenders orient. Grab battery organisms, metal stockpiles, portable resources. Retreat at speed. Gone before coordinated response forms.

**Key asymmetry:** Daysiders own the open ground. Terminators own the towers. Mounted raids can destroy exposed targets — grass-field battery farms, inter-tower caravans, outlying root-highway infrastructure — but cannot crack a well-defended tower (the lattice is an impregnable fortress to a mounted raider). Terminators cannot pursue or project power into open daysider territory.

### §7.3 Strategic Dynamic

Classic steppe nomad vs. settled civilization. The mounted daysiders are mobile, dispersed, and strike from unexpected directions. The terminator amorphs are rich, fortified, and slow to project force.

Terminator adaptations (defensive):
- Enhanced fairy-ring perimeter (earlier detection, but ~30 s is a hard floor given sprint speed)
- Battery-farm relocation to tower interiors (deny soft targets)
- Root-highway fortification (choke-point defenses)
- Inter-tower convoy escort (costly; ties down defenders)

Daysider adaptations (offensive):
- Longer-range raids with battery-organism fuel trains
- Feint-and-strike tactics (multiple approach vectors, real attack on the undefended one)
- Polar-gateway flanking (where mound is thin and inter-tower gaps wider)
- Intelligence via EM eavesdropping on tower fairy-ring traffic
- Spring-to-spring logistics: staging oases along raid corridors, cultivated thorn-flora charging stations at each spring, pre-positioned battery reserves. Raid range limited by oasis spacing — dense fracture zones enable deeper penetration toward the terminator

Escalation spiral drives both sides toward the warfare hub's escalation ladder. The mounted raid is a new rung — below deliberate tower assault, above individual banditry.

### §7.4 Terminator Counter-Mount Problem

Terminators cannot ride gazelles. The organism is a daysider specialist — evolved for solar energy, warm temperatures, thorn-flora charging ecology. At the terminator (240K, perpetual fog, no direct solar): solar PV output drops to negligible, atmospheric intake alone is insufficient for an organism this size, thorn-flora ecology is absent (towers outcompete). The gazelle cannot survive in the terminator ecology.

Terminator responses to the mounted threat are therefore defensive (see §7.3) or technological (industrial vehicles — see Open Questions). The mount is a daysider monopoly for as long as the military contest remains pre-industrial.

---

## §8 Open Questions

**□ Terminator industrial counter:** Do terminators develop manufactured vehicles (H₂ pneumatic, electric rotary, wheeled) as a counter to the mounted daysider threat? The spine notes "Wheel as vehicle: late, optional" — does the mounted raider threat make it early and necessary?

**□ Gazelle taxonomy:** How many species of large daysider runner exist? Is the mount a single species domesticated in one event, or multiple domestication events from related species (cf. horses, donkeys, onagers on Earth)?

**□ ESA in marine ecology:** Does ESA enable larger active middle-kingdom organisms in the ammonia seas? The marine environment has different constraints (buoyancy, involuntary broadcast, petrification) — does ESA matter there?

**□ Night-side ecology:** Do ESA-capable organisms exist on the dark side? Lower energy budget (no solar), but subwoofer packs already operate there. Dark-side runners would be smaller and slower than daysider specialists.

**□ Balloon fauna interaction:** Do mounted daysiders threaten balloon transit routes? Mounted archers (railgun-equipped riders) could potentially target low-altitude balloon organisms — a new predation vector.

**□ Role in crisis/space arc:** Unknown. This is a poorly-developed narrative element. The mount may remain purely a daysider military/transport innovation, or it may play a role in the forced-cooperation dynamics of the atmospheric crisis. Parked pending narrative development.

**□ Thorn-flora co-domestication:** Do daysider amorphs also domesticate thorn-flora (cultivated charging stations along raid routes)? The spine notes "farmed CaF₂ thorn ammunition (thorn-plant cultivation in deposition zone with fluoride-enriched substrate)" — thorn-flora agriculture already exists. Cultivated charging-pad orchards would extend mounted raider range.

**□ Gazelle intelligence ceiling:** As a middle-kingdom organism (individual learning only, no inherited memory), the gazelle cannot be trained in the way an Earth horse is trained. Steering is electrical (charge injection), not behavioral (learned commands). Does the domestic breeding program produce any increase in behavioral complexity, or is the organism permanently at the "livestock" cognitive level?

**□ Spring H₂O contamination gradient:** Do springs closer to active volcanic provinces have higher H₂O content (more volcanic outgassing, less SiH₄ scavenging)? If so, this creates a habitability gradient: safest oases are far from active volcanism (clean springs but fewer metal deposits), richest oases are near volcanism (metals but contaminated water). Classic risk/reward ecology.

**□ Aquifer warfare:** Can the terminator or daysider amorphs deliberately poison, block, or divert underground ammonia flow? Deliberate sinkhole induction (deferred in warfare hub) becomes strategically relevant if it can cut aquifer corridors feeding daysider oases. Siege by dehydration.

**□ Daysider settlement morphology:** Do daysider amorph settlements at oases develop characteristic structure? Spring-centered, thorn-flora-ringed, SiC-composite corrals for gazelle herds? How does oasis size limit settlement population? The oasis IS the city — its carrying capacity is set by spring flow rate, thorn-flora density, and fracture-delivered metal availability.
