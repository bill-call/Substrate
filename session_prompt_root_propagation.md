# SESSION PROMPT: Tower Surface-Root Propagation

## Setup

Follow CLAUDE.md session protocol. Load spine (`substrate_spine.md`). Additionally load:
- Chemistry Hub (`substrate_silicon_chemistry_hub.md`) §6 (carbosilane pathway → SiC), §8 (metallosilazane catalysis), §14 (void genesis — the deep-rock growth mechanism that roots extend)
- Pool Genesis Hub (`substrate_pool_genesis_hub.md`) §2.5 (genesis reactor — proto-tower context, H₂O levels)
- Geology Hub (`substrate_planetary_geology_hub.md`) §6 (petrification chemistry — K ≈ 1.6×10⁵, the 6 ppm threshold, defense mechanisms)

Load on demand (not pre-loaded):
- Fauna Structural Hub — if discussing symbiote role in root maintenance
- Bible §10 (Network) — if discussing network expansion / colonization in detail

## Context: What's Established

### Tower Growth Model (spine, all resolved)
- **Coral model.** Living layer SUBSURFACE (mm-cm below exterior). Sacrificial crust outward. Structural lattice inward. Self-regulating.
- **Lattice = N-doped SiC.** Metabolic waste of deep-rock colony. Dead lattice conducts (physical property) but carries no signals. Living layer is silazane-based biology.
- **Towers migrate day-ward:** sand-dune mechanism (windward erodes, leeward accretes). ~mm/yr at terminator.
- **Ghost roots:** abandoned root trails underground behind every migrated tower. Fossil archive.

### Network Expansion (spine, resolved)
- Root network spreads from mature towers. Network ping rules determine when a new tower buds FROM the root. Bud creates voltage/signal gradient.
- Tower-coupled symbiotes (Healers, Miners, Guards) follow gradient in propagule-distribution state, maintaining Schottky coupling with conductive root surface for energy en route.
- Journey is generational if distance requires.
- Amorphs are NOT involved in colonization.

### Petrification Chemistry (geology hub §6, resolved)
- Si-NH-Si + H₂O → Si-O-Si + NH₃. K ≈ 1.6 × 10⁵ at 240K.
- Silazane bonds thermodynamically untenable above ~6 ppm H₂O in liquid NH₃.
- Living tissue survives only through active metabolic repair (costs SiH₄).
- Dead organisms petrify to equilibrium → glass fossils.

### H₂O Levels by Environment (resolved)
| Environment | H₂O | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh terminator rain | <0.1 ppm | Distillation shield (NH₃ vapor pressure >> H₂O) |
| Genesis pools (primordial) | <1 ppm | Rain-fed, fresh, no hydrothermal accumulation |
| Modern terminator pools | ? | Unclear — intermediate? |
| Ammonia seas (modern) | ~50 ppm | Hydrothermal injection + meteoritic + photochemical accumulation |
| Vent-adjacent sea floor | <5 ppm | Reducing buffer from vent fluids |

### Genesis Reactor Model (pool genesis hub §2.5, just resolved)
- Proto-tower is the surface expression of a deep-rock colony with active fracture network.
- Genesis pools at the proto-tower base received geothermal SiH₄, metals, warm fluids — all via the fracture network.
- Organisms born in the tower's resource shadow are pre-adapted for symbiosis.
- The proto-tower's roots extended through/around these genesis pools during the primordial era when pool H₂O was <1 ppm.

## Three Questions to Resolve

### Q1: Chemistry of Surface-Root Propagation

How does a tower root grow along the surface? The deep-rock colony grows through fracture networks underground by depositing N-doped SiC as metabolic waste. When the colony reaches the surface and a tower buds, roots must also extend laterally along or just below the surface to connect towers and eventually bridge to other colonies.

What is the growth front? Is it:
- The same deep-rock chemolithotrophic metabolism (geothermal SiH₄ in fractures), now accessing atmospheric SiH₄ at/near the surface?
- A modified surface metabolism using atmospheric SiH₄ directly?
- Something else?

What is the substrate? Underground roots grow through rock fractures with mineral walls. Surface roots grow through:
- Silicate regolith/sediment at the terminator
- SiC-polished bedrock on the dark side
- Ammonia-saturated ground near pools/seas

How fast? Tower migration is ~mm/yr. Root propagation presumably faster (root needs to reach the next tower site before the tower can bud). What limits the rate?

### Q2: Growth Mediation — Signal Control

What controls WHERE a root grows and WHEN it stops?

The spine says "network ping rules determine when a new tower buds FROM the root." This implies the root network has signal propagation (the lattice is conductive N-doped SiC). But the growth front is living tissue — it's the organism itself, not the dead lattice.

**Preferred solution direction:** Tower-mediated signals controlling root growth. The deep-rock colony / tower network sends signals through the conductive lattice that modulate the growth front's behavior. The growth front is not autonomous — it responds to network signals. This gives the network architectural control over its own expansion.

Questions to resolve:
- What signal modulates growth? Electrical (voltage gradient)? Chemical (metabolite concentration)? Both?
- How does the growth front "decide" direction? Tropism toward what gradient?
- How does the network suppress unwanted growth (roots going the wrong direction, roots growing too fast, roots growing into hazardous environments)?
- Is the growth front itself capable of local decision-making, or is it purely network-directed?

### Q3: Why Don't Roots Fill Every Pool and Sea?

This is the critical constraint question. Tower roots are SiC-depositing organisms that grow laterally. Ammonia pools and seas are right there at the tower base. Why doesn't every root grow into the adjacent liquid and fill the basin with lattice?

If roots DID fill every pool, there would be no ammonia seas, no marine ecology, no shore zone — the tower would consume its own hydrological environment. Something stops root growth at the water's edge.

**Suggested mechanism: H₂O petrification halts the growth front.**

The growth front is living silazane tissue. When it contacts liquid ammonia with >6 ppm H₂O, the tissue petrifies (K ≈ 1.6 × 10⁵). Dead lattice cannot grow. The root stops.

This works cleanly IF modern pools/seas have H₂O above the petrification threshold. Modern seas (~50 ppm) clearly do. But what about terminator pools?

**The implication:** Modern terminator pools must have H₂O significantly above genesis-era levels (<1 ppm). This is plausible — the H₂O ratchet (geology hub §5) means atmospheric and dissolved H₂O have been accumulating for billions of years. Even rain-fed pools now carry more H₂O than primordial pools did. But exactly how much? And is there a gradient (pools near vents are lower H₂O due to reducing buffer, pools far from vents are higher)?

**Why this didn't stop primordial roots:** Genesis pools were <1 ppm H₂O. The proto-tower's roots COULD grow through/around primordial pools without petrification. This is consistent with the genesis reactor model — the roots and pools coexisted during the primordial era.

**Alternative or complementary mechanisms to consider:**
- Buoyancy: root lattice is dense (SiC ~3200 kg/m³) but the growth front needs gas exchange. Submerged growth front can't access atmospheric SiH₄ efficiently.
- Metabolic rate: dissolved SiH₄ is ~10,000× slower to deliver than atmospheric. Growth front starves underwater.
- Signal attenuation: liquid NH₃ (dielectric ~22) might attenuate or distort the network signals that guide growth.
- Evolutionary constraint: the network "learned" not to grow into water because it's metabolically wasteful.

These could complement the petrification mechanism rather than replace it.

## Constraints to Respect

- The deep-rock colony is chemolithotrophic. Its core metabolism: geothermal SiH₄ → Si + H₂ (energy) + SiC (structural waste).
- N-doped SiC is the lattice material. N doping comes from NH₃ incorporation during deposition.
- The living layer is silazane-based. Vulnerable to H₂O.
- Tower-coupled symbiotes (Healers, Miners, Guards) operate only on established lattice with compatible signals. They follow root expansion but don't drive it.
- The network is a blindsight alien — vastly intelligent but not conscious. Signal-mediated growth control must be mechanistic, not intentional.
- Root propagation must work without amorphs (spine: "amorphs are NOT involved in colonization").

## Output

Resolve all three questions with chemistry grounded in the established biochemistry. The petrification-halt mechanism for Q3 is preferred if it survives scrutiny — if it doesn't, explain why and propose an alternative.

Aim for material suitable for:
- A new spine entry under DEEP-ROCK BIOSPHERE (root propagation chemistry)
- Updates to Pool Genesis Hub §2.5 (root-pool interaction during genesis)
- A potential new section in the bible (§10.x: Root Propagation and Growth Control)

Flag any decisions that require choices beyond this session's scope.

Keep the user's preferences: technical peer interaction, pushback when warranted, no ego-boosting.
