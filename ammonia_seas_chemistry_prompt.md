# SUBSTRATE WORLDBUILDING — SESSION PROMPT

## CONTEXT

You are continuing a multi-session worldbuilding collaboration for a hard SF novel called SUBSTRATE. The world features silicon-based life on a tidally locked planet orbiting a red dwarf.

## KEY DOCUMENTS TO LOAD

1. **substrate_silicon_chemistry_hub.md** (v1.9) — Master chemistry reference. Contains abiogenesis pathway (§14), tower genesis (§15), and all resolved chemistry.

2. **substrate_memory_architecture_hub.md** (v1.6) — Memory system: ROM library, charge-buffer, telomere-analog forgetting, priority markers, PTSD mechanism, Monk interventions.

3. **substrate_fluorine_ecology__2_.docx** — Thorn-flowers (solar harvesters, independent of tower grid), fluorine vipers, flash-hoppers.

4. **substrate_historical_timeline.md** (v1.1) — Key-rot plagues, daysider exodus, BM/AM discontinuity, Monk rise.

5. **substrate_scaffolding_v2_1.md** — Narrative structure, four actors, daysider origins (UPDATED with correct refugee story, not diaspora).

## WHAT'S ESTABLISHED

### Two Genesis Pathways (§14 of Chemistry Hub)

**Void genesis (towers):**
- Hypercycles form on void floors where metals concentrate
- Race upward to intercept feedstock
- Winner becomes tower
- Towers are non-replicating, piezoelectric lattice organisms

**Pool genesis (amorphs/sexuals):**
- Ammonia pools in terminator basins (condensation line = terminator at 240K)
- Different chemistry — liquid phase, not gas/solid interface
- Lightning access (pools are directly under the permanent terminator storm)
- Produces mobile, replicating organisms
- Two lineages diverge: amorphs (merge-based) and sexuals (gamete-based)

### The Gap

The Chemistry Hub has detailed void genesis but pool genesis is less developed. We need:

1. **Pool chemistry specifics** — How does the ammonia pool environment differ from void cracks? What reactions dominate?

2. **Compartmentalization** — How do mobile organisms achieve containment? (Towers use rock walls; pools need something else)

3. **The lineage split** — What drives divergence into amorph vs sexual reproduction strategies?

4. **Symbiote origin** — The "ants" that colonize towers came from pools. How does wind delivery work? What pre-adapts them for tower symbiosis?

## RELEVANT ESTABLISHED CHEMISTRY

- Ammonia is the solvent (liquid range 196K–293K at 8 bar; condensation from atmosphere at 240K where P_NH₃ = 1.0 bar)
- Silazane (Si-NH-Si) is the biological matrix, NOT siloxane
- Polysilane backbone for information storage
- Metallosilazane enzymes with specific metal centers (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co)
- Energy from silane oxidation (SiH₄ + NH₃ → silazane + H₂)
- 1.82g gravity affects everything
- Atmosphere: 8 bar, N₂ 55%, H₂ 15%, NH₃ 12.5%, CH₄ 10%, SiH₄ 0.3%
- Air density at terminator: 8.2 kg/m³ (6.8× Earth)

## ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS

- Pools form at the terminator where ammonia rain falls (condensation line = 240K)
- Temperature ~240K (−33°C) in terminator basins; cooler (215–235K) in night-side basins
- Lightning: YES — continuous at terminator, directly over pools
- Energy sources: lightning (direct), geothermal (terminator = fracture zone), chemical gradients
- Wind: 9.5 m/s sustained at terminator (370 Pa dynamic pressure ≈ 25 m/s on Earth)
- Wind blows night→day (delivers pool organisms toward day-side towers)
- Both genesis environments (voids and pools) share the terminator; divergence is phase, not geography

## SESSION GOAL

Deep dive on ammonia pool genesis chemistry:
- What reactions bootstrap life in pools vs voids?
- How does compartmentalization evolve in liquid phase?
- What drives the amorph/sexual split?
- How do pool organisms become tower symbiotes?

## WORKING METHOD

The user prefers:
- Rigorous chemistry (check bond energies, reaction feasibility)
- Tables for clarity
- Explicit marking of resolved vs open questions
- Building toward hub document updates
- Honest critique of proposals
