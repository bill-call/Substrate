# SUBSTRATE — TRANSCRIPTION BOTTLENECK: DESIGN OPTIONS

**Micro-document for narrative instance**

---

## THE CONSTRAINT

Transcription (buffer → library) is slower than experience accumulation. That's chemistry. Everything else is design choice.

---

## POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

| Solution | Mechanism | Consequence |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Sleep (human-style) | Periodic downtime for transcription catch-up | Vulnerability window, circadian rhythm |
| Continuous triage | Constant background transcription of highest-priority only | Most experiences never saved; ruthless selection |
| Parallel transcription | Multiple transcription systems running simultaneously | Higher energy cost, higher throughput |
| Distributed processing | Different body regions transcribe independently | No central bottleneck; fragmented archive |
| Selective attention | Only attend to (and thus buffer) what you intend to keep | Sparse experience, minimal buffer load |
| Accept loss | Let buffer overflow; don't save everything | Most of life is ephemeral; only peaks recorded |
| Activity cycling | Alternate between high-input and low-input behaviors | Not "sleep" — deliberate lifestyle pattern |

## NARRATIVE OPTIONS

1. **They don't sleep** — continuous triage, most experience lost, only important moments transcribed. Life is mostly ephemeral. Memories are sparse highlights.

2. **They choose stillness** — deliberate periods of low-input to let transcription catch up. Not unconscious, just quiet. Meditation, not sleep.

3. **Size-dependent** — smaller amorphs (less buffer, less transcription capacity) need more downtime. Larger ones can run hotter.

4. **Grid-dependent** — grid connection provides external processing support. Grid-huggers can offload; sun-eaters must manage alone.
