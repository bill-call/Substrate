## 1. THE ENERGY PARADOX

Atmospheric SiH₄ at 0.3% in 8-bar atmosphere provides ~39 g/m³ of metabolic fuel. At 9.5 m/s terminator wind, a 1 m² cross-section intercepts ~1,300 kg/hr of SiH₄. A 100 kg amorph at rest needs ~1 kg/hr. The ratio of delivery to need is ~1,300:1.

**Energy is not the binding constraint. It never was.**

But POWER — the rate of energy delivery to where it's needed, when it's needed — is scarce. The distinction between energy (total available) and power (rate of delivery) structures the entire amorph economy.

---

## 2. CHARGE AS THE BINDING CONSTRAINT

### 2.1 The Two Storage Pools

| Pool | Medium | Charge rate | Discharge rate | Capacity | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Chemical** | Polysilane oil reserves | Slow (atmospheric SiH₄ metabolism) | Slow (enzymatic conversion) | ~15% body mass, 0.76 kJ/g | Fuel tank. Baseline sustenance. |
| **Electrical** | Semiconductor junction network (capacitive/electrochemical) | Fast (tower grid) or slow (self-metabolism) | Fast (direct to cognition, actuators, tools) | Limited | Battery. Burst capability. Thinking. |

The chemical pool sustains life. The electrical pool sustains *civilization*.

### 2.2 Demand Spikes

| Activity | Power draw | Duration | Pool used |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resting | 300W | Indefinite (atmospheric SiH₄ sufficient) | Chemical |
| Active foraging | 750W | Hours | Chemical + electrical |
| Sustained cognition | Variable, scales with WM size | Hours–days | **Electrical** (primary) |
| Combat/reconfiguration | Up to 5,000W | Seconds–minutes | **Electrical** (burst) |
| Arc-CVD repair | Tower-powered | Minutes | Grid direct |
| Manufacturing | Tower-powered | Hours | Grid direct |

Demand spikes exceed what atmospheric SiH₄ metabolism can deliver in real time. Stored charge bridges the gap. When stored charge depletes, the amorph must either reduce activity or recharge at a tower.

### 2.3 Thinking Is Expensive

The amorph neural system is electronic — semiconductor junctions drawing current. Every thought is a line item in the power budget. Implications:

- **Cognitive capacity degrades with charge depletion.** Low battery = dumber, slower, reactive not deliberative.
- **Stillness = intelligence.** A still amorph devotes full power budget to cognition. A moving amorph splits power between locomotion, reconfiguration, sensing, AND thinking.
- **Grid-connected amorphs are smarter** — not because of hardware differences, but because of unlimited power for sustained thought.
- **Writing is a battery-saving technology.** Offloads working memory to a zero-power medium.
- **Formal math is late** because abstract reasoning is high-power (active WM manipulation), while native arithmetic is low-power (hardwired circuits).

### 2.4 Tower as Charger

The tower grid (piezoelectric + photovoltaic + lightning) provides electrical energy directly. An amorph plugged into a tower root can charge its internal electrical pool orders of magnitude faster than self-metabolism from atmospheric SiH₄.

**This is the fundamental amorph-tower economic relationship: power delivery rate.**

## 3. EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS

### 3.1 Stage 0 — Downwind Scavenging

Before amorphs ever touched a tower, they discovered that positioning downwind was profitable. Dead tower fauna — cleared from the lattice by garbage-collector Healer sub-castes — enters the windstream and is carried day-ward as a continuous plume. Terminator rain captures most of this plume; dead material accumulates in ammonia runoff drainage channels.

Amorphs intercept this stream:
- **Airborne interception:** Deploy catch-net body geometry in windstream. Catches fresh corpses — best for metals (pre-petrification) and library fragments.
- **Ammonia runoff filtering:** Filter terminator drainage channels. Volume play — SiC plates intact, metals partially locked by advancing petrification.

The dead-bug stream provides:
- **SiC plates** (~5mm, from insect-scale exoskeletons) — durable, verifiable, tradeable
- **Catalytic metals** (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co in metallosilazane enzymes) — time-limited, petrification locks them into glass matrix
- **Library fragments** — very time-limited, degrade rapidly after death

This is foraging. The tower doesn't know the amorphs are there.

### 3.2 Stage 1 — Power Parasitism

Some downwind scavengers wander closer. They detect the tower's electrical gradient — waste current flowing through grounding paths. The current is edible. They plug in.

Initially invisible to the tower (drawing current that was being discarded). As parasite population grows, impedance changes accumulate. Tower evolves detection. Parasites evolve electrical camouflage. Arms race begins. (See Tower Evolution Bridge §8.2–8.3.)

**Key: amorphs are there for POWER, not SiH₄.** Atmospheric SiH₄ is free. Grid electrical is fast. The parasitism is about charge rate, not energy.

### 3.3 Stage 2 — Cooptation

Tower "rewards" beneficial behavior with electrical current. Mutualists tolerated; pure parasites killed. (Tower Evolution Bridge §8.4.)

**The amorphs optimize the reward function, not the tower's objectives.** This is a principal-agent problem from day one. The tower cannot distinguish "genuinely helpful" from "triggering the reward signal efficiently." As long as reward correlates with useful work, the system functions.

### 3.4 Stage 3 — Tool Use → Surplus

Tool use makes amorphs dramatically more efficient at earning tower reward. An amorph with the right skills generates reward in excess of personal metabolic demand.

**Surplus charge exists for the first time.** This is the critical transition.

### 3.5 Stage 4 — Battery Organisms

Surplus is useless unless storable. Amorphs breed-for-purpose biological capacitor/battery organisms — the **first domesticated species**.

Battery organisms are likely middle-kingdom tier (sexual, genomic, tower-linked) selectively bred for charge storage capacity. They're the livestock of the silicon economy: not food animals, but charge animals.

### 3.6 Stage 5 — Farmer Caste → Specialization → Trade

"Farmers" = amorphs who specialize in generating tower reward efficiently and storing surplus in battery herds. They sell stored charge to other amorphs.

Amorphs who can buy charge don't need to work the tower themselves. Freed time → other skills: tool-making, meme-crafting, exploration, art, contemplation.

**Trade economy:** specialists sell skills/memes/services for stored charge. Farmers sell stored charge for skills/memes/services. Stored charge is the original medium of exchange. This predates writing, formal governance, and possibly even language complexity.

## 4. DUAL CURRENCY

| Currency | Medium | Properties | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stored charge** | Battery organisms | Perishable (organisms discharge, need feeding). Directly useful (power tools, cognition, manufacturing). | Daily transactions, immediate needs |
| **SiC plates** | Harvested from tower fauna (~5mm) | Permanent. Durable. Verifiable (conductivity, microstructure). Intrinsic material value. | Wealth storage, long-distance trade, inter-group transactions |

Charge is cash. SiC is gold. Both circulate.

The shell economy (SiC plates) collapses when fiber composite makes SiC structurally obsolete — but SiC's *monetary* function can outlast its *material* function, just as gold remained money after ceasing to be the best material for anything. The charge economy, based on direct utility, is more resilient.

## 5. METALS AS LONG-TERM LIMITER

### 5.1 The Iron-Limited-Ocean Analogy

Catalytic metals (Ni, Fe, Ti, Co) are required for ALL metabolism (Chemistry Hub §8) but are kinetically scarce at the surface. Total metal in volcanic sediment is enormous. Bioavailable dissolved metal is limited by dissolution rate at 240K.

This parallels iron limitation in Earth's Southern Ocean: iron-rich sediments on the floor, iron-poor surface water where biology happens. The bottleneck is mobilization rate, not total inventory.

### 5.2 Metal Budget

- 100 kg amorph contains ~50–200 g catalytic metals (estimated from enzymatic requirements)
- Standing crop at 2–5/km²: ~250–1000 g metals/km²
- Annual biological recycling (deaths): ~50–250 g/km²/yr
- Geological delivery (rock weathering at 240K): slow, uncertain, likely comparable order

### 5.3 Towers as Metal Concentrators

Tower deep roots access unweathered rock in fracture networks — metals surface organisms cannot reach. The Miner guild concentrates metals in the living layer. Towers are the largest metal reservoirs in the surface biosphere.

**Original amorph-tower interaction was partly metal scavenging** (dead-bug drifts/plume), which later combined with power parasitism.

### 5.4 Reproduction Is Metal-Expensive

Budding requires dividing the catalytic metal inventory. A 100 kg parent budding a 50 kg offspring gives up ~50 g of metals — half its enzymatic capacity. Post-reproductive recovery requires re-accumulating metals. Near a tower: fast. On the peneplain: slow.

**Reproduction rate is metal-limited, not energy-limited.**

---

## 6. CONSTRAINT HIERARCHY

| Timescale | Binding constraint | What it limits |
|---|---|---|
| Seconds–hours | Stored charge / metabolic rate | Burst capability, cognition, combat, reconfiguration |
| Days–weeks | Tower recharge access | Activity budget, foraging radius, sustained thinking |
| Years–decades | Catalytic metals | Reproduction rate, population ceiling (~2–5/km²) |
| **Civilizational** | **Total grid power budget** | **Industrial capacity, night-side viability, monk support** |

---

## 7. NIGHT-SIDE POWER ECONOMY

### 7.1 The Power-Starved Dark Side

Night-side towers have:
- Geothermal from deep roots (modest)
- Root-network trickle from terminator (limited)
- Minimal piezoelectric (wind 2–8 m/s)
- Zero photovoltaic
- Atmospheric SiH₄ metabolism (chemical, not grid-electrical)

Most night-side towers operate at survival level. Population sparse, activity low.

### 7.2 Gas-Pocket Monasteries

SiH₄ formed by pressure-driven equilibrium at depth (geology hub) can be trapped in subsurface formations in the ancient, thick, cold dark-side crust. Night-side volcanism is minimal — these pockets persist for geological timescales.

A tower whose deep roots tap a gas pocket gets a **bonanza**: concentrated SiH₄ at the root → massive metabolic throughput → grid power surplus → waste heat (valuable in cold environment).

**Monasteries are at gas-pocket towers.** The geological lottery determines where sustained deep cognition is possible. The monks didn't choose contemplation then find a tower — they found a tower with surplus power, and the surplus enabled contemplation. "Physical before philosophical."

### 7.3 Gas Pockets Are Non-Renewable

No dark-side volcanism to recharge depleted pockets. The monks are living on fossil fuel. When a pocket runs dry, the monastery loses its power surplus, federation-level cognition becomes unsustainable, and the institution must relocate or die.

**The monks are the first to understand non-renewable resources — because they're living on one.**

### 7.4 Prospecting

Knowledge of gas-pocket locations is strategically critical. Monks would develop geological survey capabilities — biological seismic sensing (piezoelectric vibration through the ground), mapping subsurface fracture networks, predicting pocket locations from surface geology.

Industrial-era amorphs who develop drilling technology can tap gas pockets independently of tower roots — a civilizational inflection point (breaking the monastery monopoly on night-side energy surplus).

## 8. THE POWER CEILING AND DAY-SIDE COLONIZATION

### 8.1 The Industrial Bottleneck

As amorph civilization industrializes, power demand grows:
- Manufacturing (arc-CVD, metallurgy, fiber composite production)
- Communication infrastructure
- Transportation technology
- Support for specialist castes (monks, engineers, artists)

Terminator tower surplus (mostly lightning-derived) is the only significant power source beyond subsistence. This surplus is finite and shared via root network with the power-starved night side.

**Total grid power is the hard ceiling on industrial capacity.**

### 8.2 The Monk Proposal

The monks — who can model long-term trajectories via federation-level cognition, who understand non-renewable resources from personal experience, whose own gas pockets are slowly depleting — are the first to propose the solution:

**Day-side energy harvesting.** Solar (850nm star peak on Si bandgap — massive photovoltaic potential). Geothermal (volcanic provinces, concentrated heat). The day side has more energy than the entire night side and terminator combined, by orders of magnitude.

Initial reaction from the general population: "Are you out of your fucking mind?"

### 8.3 Why the Day Side Is Hostile

| Hazard | Mechanism | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Petrification | Higher atmospheric H₂O from volcanic outgassing | Chronic, progressive |
| Volcanism | Continuous resurfacing, 10–30 provinces | Catastrophic (local) |
| Fluorine ecology | Entire adaptive radiation weaponizing F | Lethal (SiF₄ volatilization) |
| Temperature | 245–265K (warmer than terminator) | Manageable but costly (heat dissipation) |
| No towers at scale | Volcanism + rain stripping prevent large towers | No grid infrastructure, no shelter |

### 8.4 The Progression

1. Monks propose → rejected as insane
2. Gas pockets deplete → monastery capacity declining
3. Industrial demand hits grid ceiling → brownouts, night-side towers dimming
4. First pioneers venture day-ward (desperate, ambitious, or both)
5. High mortality. Iterative development of petrification countermeasures, heat management, volcanic hazard monitoring
6. Viable day-side outposts. Energy flows back to terminator and night side.
7. Industrial capacity explodes.
8. **The same technologies that enable day-side operations — petrification defense, thermal management, hazard engineering — are prerequisites for space hardware.**

Day-side colonization is the bridge to the moonshot, not a separate program.

## 9. MEME ECONOMICS

### 9.1 Memes as IP

Memes are signed molecular machinery — they carry provenance metadata identifying their source. They encode thought/memory processing capabilities, NOT biology. A meme-less bud is biologically viable but knows nothing.

Individual memes can be:
- Deliberately withheld during budding (parents select which to transfer)
- Traded between individuals (chemical-channel transfer, no merge required)
- Monopolized by sub-groups (patent analog)
- Valued for their content (enzyme recipes, techniques, knowledge)

### 9.2 Knowledge Is Not Free

Valuable memes — efficient catalyst recipes, metallurgical techniques, federation training methods, navigation skills — can be monopolized. Holders extract economic rent. The meme economy overlays the charge and SiC economies as a third value system.

### 9.3 Three-Layer Economy

| Layer | Medium | Character |
|---|---|---|
| **Charge** | Battery organisms | Cash. Perishable. Direct utility. |
| **Material** | SiC plates, metals, manufactured goods | Commodity. Durable. Intrinsic value. |
| **Knowledge** | Memes (signed, tradeable molecular machinery) | IP. Exclusive. Value from scarcity + utility. |

## 10. TECH TREE PREREQUISITES (SUMMARY)

The technology tree from bare biology to moonshot requires clearing these gates:

| Gate | Capability | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Surplus charge generation | Tower mutualism + tool use + battery organisms |
| 2 | Specialization + trade | Surplus + communication + meme economy |
| 3 | Metallurgy | Electrical heating of native ores (reducing atmosphere = already reduced). Tower-powered. |
| 4 | Writing | SiC etching / conductive trace deposition. Enables knowledge preservation outside meme system. |
| 5 | Formal engineering | Sustained cognition (grid-powered) + writing + mathematics |
| 6 | Day-side operations | Petrification countermeasures + thermal management + volcanic monitoring |
| 7 | Large-scale manufacturing | Day-side power + metallurgy + engineering |
| 8 | Space hardware | All of the above + hot-H₂ thermal rocket chemistry + SiC composite fabrication |
| 9 | Moonshot | Space hardware + aerostat launch OR tower mass driver + federation-level mission planning |

Gate 6 (day-side operations) is the critical path bottleneck for industrial civilization. Everything after it depends on the power that only the day side can provide.

*The silicon world runs on charge, not calories. The tower is a power station, not a food source. The economy that follows is alien in its medium but utterly familiar in its logic: whoever controls the energy controls the civilization.*
