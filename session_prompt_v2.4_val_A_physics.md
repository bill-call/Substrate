# SESSION PROMPT: v2.4 Validation — Part A: Physical Plausibility

## Instructions

Follow CLAUDE.md session protocol. Load spine (`substrate_spine.md`) first. Load other documents ONLY as needed for specific checks — do not pre-load everything.

This is a READ-ONLY analysis session. Produce a PASS/CONCERN/FAIL verdict for each item with brief justification. Keep your report under 2000 words.

## Checks

### 1. Atmospheric Conveyor
Load: spine §SURFACE GEOMORPHOLOGY only.
- Does the grain-size filter argument hold? The chimney lofts only particles light enough for updraft; katabatic wind can re-entrain everything the chimney admitted. Would atmospheric scientists accept this closed-loop claim?
- Anti-stellar stagnation cap: is the "self-limiting, geologically insignificant" claim defensible?

### 2. SiC Abrasion
- SiC (Mohs 9.5) abrading silicate bedrock (Mohs 6-7) over Gyr. Is mirror-smooth peneplain physically reasonable? Estimate erosion rate order-of-magnitude.

### 3. Boundary Layer
- Re ~10¹² claimed. Check: air density 8.2 kg/m³, wind 5-8 m/s, length scale ~planetary radius 8600 km, dynamic viscosity of N₂/H₂/NH₃ mix at 220K. Is Re ~10¹² correct?
- Viscous sublayer thickness at those conditions: is ~50 μm reasonable?
- Is "aerodynamically smooth turbulent" the correct term?

### 4. Marine Physics
Load: spine §AMMONIA SEA ECOLOGY only.
- H₂O at 50 ppm in ammonia seas: consistent with atmospheric H₂O trace + concentration mechanism?
- Medusa-fish Tesla valve: can a no-moving-parts check valve be manufactured by controlled petrification of shaped tissue? (Tesla valve = asymmetric channel geometry, no biology-incompatible features.)
- Involuntary EM broadcast: NH₃ dielectric constant ~22 at 240K coupling to electronic neural processing. Does high dielectric medium enhance or attenuate EM radiation from semiconductor junctions?

### 5. Balloon Aerodynamics
Load: spine balloon fauna entries only.
- Venturi body plan: at what Reynolds numbers does this work? Estimate Re for a 1m organism in 8.2 kg/m³ air at 5-10 m/s.
- Drifter cycle: ~24-35 days for full planetary circuit. Planet circumference ~54,000 km. Superstream 50-100 m/s (2-4 day return). Surface transit 2-8 m/s (dark side ~27,000 km surface path at 5 m/s = ~60 days). Does the timing work?

### 6. Thermal Kill Zone
- Silazane biology operating at ~240K. At what temperature does silazane polymer decompose? (Polysilazanes pyrolyze to SiCN at ~800-1000°C.) Is there a biologically relevant thermal ceiling well below pyrolysis?
- SiC lattice survives to ~2700K. Is the claim "1200K+ kills biology, lattice survives" physically sound?
